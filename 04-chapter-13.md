# Part 4: Endgame Mastery (Chapters 13-15)

_This final part completes all prerequisites for the story finale, stabilizes the Prismacore to save Rainbow Island, and unlocks the post-game sandbox empire. You'll systematically open all Shadow Plort Doors, stockpile endgame resources, complete the main story, and gain access to unlimited creative ranching._

## Chapter 13: The Endgame Audit

**Mindset:** _Final preparation for Prismacore._

This chapter is about systematic completion of all prerequisites for the story finale. The primary objective is opening all 25 Shadow Plort Doors and stockpiling the resources needed for Prismacore stabilization.

### The Operational Blueprint

#### Phase 1: Shadow Plort Door Completion

**Objective:** Open all 25 Shadow Plort Doors (1,165 Shadow Plorts total)

The Shadow Plort Doors are the Grey Labyrinth's equivalent of Treasure Pods. They grant access to blueprints, upgrade components, and critical shortcuts. You MUST open all 25 before proceeding to Prismacore.

**Shadow Plort Farming Strategy:**
- Shadow Slimes spawn in groups of 2-5 in dark corners throughout Grey Labyrinth
- Hit them with ANY thrown object (they drop Shadow Plorts, item is not consumed)
- They sit motionless when undisturbed, jump when disturbed, then vanish
- Optimal farming: Carry a stack of throwable items, systematically visit dark corners
- Reference **Appendix J** (Grey Labyrinth Shadow Plort Door Locations) for all 25 door locations and costs

**Door Cost Breakdown:**
- Costs range from 25-100 Shadow Plorts per door
- Total for doors: 1,165 Shadow Plorts
- Additional for Nullifier (Chapter 14): 20 Shadow Plorts
- **Total Shadow Plorts needed: 1,185**
- **Store Shadow Plorts in SILOS** until all doors are open (cannot use Refinery plorts for doors)

**Priority Doors (open first):**
- 25 & 50 plort doors: Shortcuts and quality-of-life improvements
- 75-100 plort doors: Upgrade components (Storage Cells, Power Chips)

#### Phase 2: Prisma Plort Stockpiling

**Objective:** Stockpile ~245 Prisma Plorts total

**Prisma Plort Uses:**
- 90 for Gigi's milestone trades (Chapter 14)
- 155 for crafting upgrades (145 for Vacpack upgrades + 10 for Disruption Detector)

**Prisma Plort Farming Strategy:**
- During Prisma Disruptions, all food becomes "Unstable"
- Feed Unstable food to any slimes → produces Unstable Plorts
- Stabilize Unstable Plorts using:
  - Prisma Stabilizers (yellow portals - one-time use)
  - Ancient Stabilizers (permanent archways - reusable)
- **CRITICAL: Store Prisma Plorts in SILOS, not Refinery** (Refinery plorts cannot be traded to Gigi)

**Optimal Farming Setup:**
- Temporary Pink Slime operation near Ancient Stabilizer in Grey Labyrinth
- Collect Unstable food during disruption
- Feed Pink Slimes → Unstable Plorts
- Walk through Ancient Stabilizer → Unstable Plorts automatically convert to Prisma Plorts in your inventory
- Deposit to portable Refinery Link or return to ranch

#### Phase 3: Final Vacpack Upgrades

**Objective:** Complete all endgame Vacpack upgrades

**Required Upgrades:**
- Heart Module IV (10,000 NB + 50 Prisma/30 Honey/25 Magma Comb/1 Royal Jelly/1 Heart Cell)
- Power Core V (15,000 NB + 50 Prisma/40 Twin/25 Tin Petal/1 Royal Jelly/1 Power Chip)
- Tank Booster V (15,000 NB + 50 Sloomber/20 Prisma/20 Black Indigonium/1 Royal Jelly/1 Storage Cell)
- Tank Booster VI (20,000 NB + 60 Twin/25 Prisma/20 Dream Bubble/3 Sun Sap/1 Storage Cell)
- Tank Booster VII (30,000 NB + 70 Hyper/50 Sloomber/20 Magma Comb/3 Royal Jelly/1 Storage Cell)
- Tank Booster VIII (50,000 NB + 80 Ringtail/50 Twin/30 Aqua Glass/3 Royal Jelly/1 Storage Cell)

**All required resources should be available from:**
- Grey Labyrinth resource nodes (Magma Comb, Tin Petal, Black Indigonium, Aqua Glass, Dream Bubble, Royal Jelly)
- Chapter 11-12 slime operations (Twin, Sloomber, Hyper, Ringtail plorts)
  - If you skipped Chapter 12: Farm wild Hyper slimes in Grey Labyrinth Terrarium for 70 Hyper Plorts
  - Ringtail plorts available from Chapter 8's Batty-Ringtail largos if Chapter 12 skipped
- Shadow Plort Door rewards (Storage Cells, Power Chips, Heart Cells)

#### Phase 4: Craft Disruption Detector

**Blueprint:** Obtained from Gigi in Impossible Sky area
**Recipe:** 500 NB + 10 Prisma Plorts + 5 Tin Petal + 5 Dream Bubble

**Usage:** Place in Grey Labyrinth to add map pins showing disruption status:
- White icon = No disruption
- Yellow icon = Upcoming disruption
- Red icon = Disruption ongoing

This helps optimize Prisma Plort farming timing.

#### Phase 5: Ranch Automation Verification

**Checklist:**
- ✅ All corrals have Auto-Feeders installed and stocked
- ✅ All corrals have Plort Collectors installed
- ✅ Quantum Drones (if installed) are functioning correctly
- ✅ Food gardens are producing and restocked
- ✅ Coops are producing chickens
- ✅ Ranch can operate autonomously while you're in Grey Labyrinth

#### Advanced Grey Labyrinth Teleporter (Optional Quality-of-Life)

Complete Grey Labyrinth coverage with internal fast travel between distant zones.

**Berry Teleporter - Grey Labyrinth Internal (Impossible Sky ↔ Lava Depths)**
- Impossible Sky ↔ Lava Depths
- 4,000 NB + 30 Sloomber Plorts + 20 Tin Petal + 10 Black Indigonium + 10 Magma Comb + 2 Royal Jelly

### End of Chapter Checklist

By the end of Chapter 13, you should have:
- ✅ All 25 Shadow Plort Doors opened (1,165 Shadow Plorts spent)
- ✅ ~245 Prisma Plorts stockpiled in SILOS
- ✅ Heart Module IV, Power Core V, Tank Booster V-VIII crafted
- ✅ Disruption Detector crafted and placed
- ✅ Ranch automation verified as self-sufficient
- ✅ Ready for Prismacore finale

### Next Chapter Preparation

With all Shadow Plort Doors open and Prisma Plorts stockpiled, you're ready to enter the Prismacore and complete the main story.

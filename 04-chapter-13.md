> **⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS:** This chapter is not yet completed or fully verified. Content may be incomplete, inaccurate, or subject to significant changes.

**Mindset:** _Strategic endgame extraction._

The Grey Labyrinth is the ultimate challenge - a dangerous, high-reward zone containing the rarest slimes and materials in the game. Execute strategic objectives to extract these valuable endgame assets.

### The Operational Blueprint

#### Phase 1: Prerequisites & Initial Entry

Success in the Labyrinth is determined before you step inside. Entry is restricted, and survival demands peak equipment. This phase details the mandatory gear and the key gadget required for access: the Radiant Projector.

**Key Gadget: The Radiant Projector**

The Radiant Projector is a craftable utility gadget that acts as a mirror, allowing you to redirect beams of light. It is essential for solving the puzzles that lock the main entrance to the Grey Labyrinth and for navigating deeper within.

**How to Unlock the Radiant Projector Blueprint:**

**Blueprint Source:** Viktor Humphries (NPC scientist) gives you the blueprint via a comm station call.

**Unlock Requirements:** Viktor's call will occur automatically when you meet BOTH of these conditions:

- You have popped either the Boom Gordo (Ember Valley) OR the Flutter Gordo (Starlight Strand)
- It is at least Day 20 of your playthrough (in-game days, not real time)

**Timeline If Following This Guide:**

- Chapter 3 (Days 8-12): You pop the Boom Gordo in Ember Valley
- Chapter 4 (Days 13-17): You pop the Flutter Gordo in Starlight Strand
- Day 20: Viktor's comm station call triggers automatically
- Day 20+: Radiant Projector blueprint becomes available at your Fabricator

**Important Notes:**

Viktor's call is AUTOMATIC - you don't need to do anything special to trigger it. After receiving the call, check your Fabricator - the Radiant Projector blueprint will be unlocked. You don't need to craft Radiant Projectors immediately - wait until you're ready to enter the Grey Labyrinth (Chapter 13). The game ensures you have the blueprint well before you need it (Chapter 13 will be much later than Day 20 if following this guide).

**If Viktor Hasn't Called Yet:**

Check your current in-game day (visible on your save file timestamp). Verify you've popped at least one of the required Gordos (Boom or Flutter). If you've met both requirements and it's past Day 20, the call may trigger when you next return to the Conservatory or sleep. Viktor's calls are persistent - you cannot miss them permanently.

**Radiant Projector Crafting Recipe:**

Once unlocked, the Radiant Projector can be crafted at the Fabricator:

- Cost: 500 Newbucks
- Materials: 10 Hunter Plorts, 10 Boom Plorts, 5 Silky Sand, 5 Lava Dust
- Quantity: Craft 3-4 Radiant Projectors before entering the Grey Labyrinth
- Reusability: Radiant Projectors are placeable gadgets that can be picked up and reused, but having multiple allows you to solve complex multi-mirror puzzles without backtracking

**Prerequisite Checklist**

- **Required Vacpack Status (from Chapter 12 Audit):**
  - **Health/Energy:** Heart Module III (250 HP), Power Core III (250 Energy)
  - **Mobility:** Jetpack II, Dash Boots II
  - **Inventory/Defense:** Tank Booster III, Extra Tank, Tank Guard, Water Tank, Pulse Wave
- **Required Expedition Kit (In Inventory):**
  - **Entry Tools:** At least 3-4 crafted Radiant Projectors. While they are reusable, carrying several allows you to solve complex puzzles without having to backtrack.
  - **Puzzle Items:** A stack of Hunter Plorts and Angler Plorts.
  - **Utility:** A full stack of a throwable item (e.g., Pink Plorts) for dealing with Shadow Slimes.

**Executing Entry**

- **Entry Points:**
  - **Ember Valley:** Enter the portal revealed after popping the Boom Gordo in the western volcanic area.
  - **Starlight Strand:** Enter the portal revealed after popping the Flutter Gordo in the southern central cave.
- **Entry Puzzle (Starlight Strand Route):**
  - The door to the Grey Labyrinth is located directly under where the Flutter Gordo was positioned
  - You need 2 Radiant Projectors to solve the light puzzle:
    - **First Projector:** Capture the yellow light beam emanating from the nearby Slime Statue
    - **Second Projector:** Bounce the captured light to the triangle-shaped light switch/sensor on the door
    - When correctly aligned, the beam turns YELLOW and the door opens
  - **Ember Valley Route:** Similar light puzzle mechanics (specific configuration TBD)

#### Phase 2: Labyrinth Cartography - Zones & Hazards

The Labyrinth is a massive, multi-level environment. Your first priority is understanding its layout and unique dangers. **Key Zones:**

- **Waterworks (Hub):** The central aquatic hub area. Features underwater elements (coral, anemones), pipes, and waterworks infrastructure. Only source of Aqua Glass in the Labyrinth. Best accessed via Starlight Strand portal entrance. Contains multiple locked rooms opened by plort statues or buttons. Has 3 unique plort statues. Features vertical stacking of rooms, making map navigation challenging. Connects to Impossible Sky, Dream Land, and other major zones.
- **Impossible Sky:** A grassy, overgrown area with ruinous architecture. Contains Twin Slimes, Polaricherry trees, Black Indigonium nodes, and Royal Jelly. Features three plort statues of Labyrinth-exclusive slimes (Shadow, Twin, Sloomber). Twin Gordo located here (unlocks portal to Rainbow Fields). Accessible from Waterworks or Lava Depths. Grey Labyrinth Portal leads to a platform in this area. The gilded area surrounding the Prismacore (formerly called "Prismacore Surroundings") is part of this zone.
- **Lava Depths:** A volcanic area similar to Ember Valley's Boom Gordo region. Contains Magma Comb resource nodes. Accessed via Ember Valley portal (behind Boom Gordo) with Radiant Projector puzzle. Features 3 Rock plort statues and 1 Boom plort statue that unlock shortcuts. Connects to Impossible Sky and Terrarium. Contains 4 Shadow Plort Doors. Map navigation extremely difficult due to heavily stacked rooms and corridors on multiple vertical levels.
- **Dream Land:** The largest and most northern area of the Labyrinth. Contains magenta vegetation, ruinous architecture with windmills, floating debris, and Royal Jelly. This is where the Labyrinth's atmosphere is generated. Divided into 3 sub-areas:
  - **Central:** First arrival point from Impossible Sky. No Sloomber Slimes or Candied Hens.
  - **North:** Accessed via pipes from east side or flying from west. Requires Radiant Projector puzzle to permanently open door. Contains Sloomber Gordo (portal to Conservatory).
  - **West:** Accessed via Radiant Projector puzzle (4+ projectors needed) or flying from north. Contains Shadow Plort Door shortcut to Waterworks (southwest corner, connects to hedge maze).
- **Terrarium:** A sealed overgrown greenhouse biodome described by Gigi as likely a seed bank. Contains plants, food, resources, and slimes from most Rainbow Island regions. Only natural spawn location of Hyper Slimes and Turbo Taters. Indoor areas feature miniature models/dioramas of Grey Labyrinth locations and other Rainbow Island areas. Contains Hyper Gordo. Located north of Lava Depths, east of Prismacore. **Access:** Requires 3 Radiant Projectors, 1 Hunter Plort, 1 Angler Plort. Entry puzzle is at the Lava Depths/Impossible Sky transition (building with 4 pipes - 2 water, 2 lava). Completing puzzle raises platforms from clouds (use water spout on Prismacore bridge or Jetpack with Power Core II to reach). Contains 6 Shadow Plort Doors.
- **Prismacore:** The final zone and the source of the Labyrinth's Prisma Disruptions. Accessed via plort doors (Twin, Shadow, Sloomber required). Contains Gigi's exchange station and the story finale.

**Shadow Plort Doors (Moon/Sun Symbol System):**

The 25 Shadow Plort Doors are the Grey Labyrinth's equivalent of Treasure Pods:
- **Visual Appearance:** Shaped like Refinery Links with a sun-meter dial above. Doors have Moon/Sun symbols (black and yellow pokeball-like icon on map)
- **Map Tracking:** Shows as "0/25" - tracks how many Shadow Plort Doors you've opened
- **Opening Mechanic:** Deposit Shadow Plorts into the door. The sun meter slowly transitions to night-time (crescent moon), then unlocks
- **Currency:** Requires varying amounts of Shadow Plorts (25-100 per door)
- **Total Count:** 25 Shadow Plort Doors throughout the Grey Labyrinth (19 in main areas, 6 in The Terrarium)
- **Rewards:** Blueprints, upgrade components (Storage Cells, Power Chips, modules), decorations, and shortcuts
- **Total Shadow Plorts Needed:** 1,165 to open all 25 doors (costs range from 15-100 per door)

**Critical Hazards**

- **Prisma Disruptions:** Reality-altering energy waves that periodically sweep through the zones. They can cause gravity inversion, time dilation, or environmental damage. During a disruption, all loose food and plorts in the affected area become "Unstable."
- **Dream Land Trap:** If you enter Dream Land North via the pipes without unlocking the west Radiant Projector puzzle (requires 4+ projectors) and lack sufficient mobility upgrades (Jetpack II or higher for flying), you can get trapped. Escape options: Emergency Return (requires Tank Guard), pop Sloomber Gordo and use Conservatory portal, or complete the puzzle.
- **Unstable Items:** Items with the "Unstable" status are highly volatile and will randomly JUMP out of your Vacpack and scatter everywhere. The ejection happens unpredictably and frequently - you cannot hold them for long. They also instantly pop out if you take damage. Unstable items will eventually vanish from the world if left unstabilized. **CRITICAL:** Unstable items conflict with warp technology - you cannot use teleporters/warp depots while carrying Unstable items in your vac. You must stabilize these items quickly using one of two methods:
  - **Prisma Stabilizers:** Yellow floating portal-like objects that spawn during disruptions and remain after the event ends. Shoot or toss Unstable items through them to stabilize. **IMPORTANT:** Prisma Stabilizers are consumable and disappear after being used once.
  - **Stabilizing Gates:** Permanent archway structures found throughout the Labyrinth. Walk through them while holding Unstable items in your vac to stabilize them, or shoot Unstable items through them. One Stabilizing Gate is obtainable as a craftable blueprint from a Shadow Plort Door (75 Shadow Plorts). Can be placed at your ranch for convenient Prisma Plort farming.
  - **Result:** Unstable Plorts stabilized through either method become valuable **Prisma Plorts**.
  - **Important:** If your vac tank is full of Prisma Plorts when walking through a Stabilizing Gate with Unstable Plorts, the newly converted Prisma Plorts will eject from your vac all at once.
- **No Slime Sea:** The bottom of the Labyrinth is a cloud ocean (not the Slime Sea). Any slimes, items, or ranchers that fall in are PERMANENTLY LOST. There is no recovery.
- **Tarr Risk:** Tarr are very common in the Grey Labyrinth due to the high variety of slimes and abundant food. Water Tank and Hydro Turrets strongly recommended.

#### Phase 3: Asset Identification - New Species & Resources

The Labyrinth contains the most valuable and volatile assets in the game. Identifying them is key to unlocking the final tier of upgrades. **New Slime Species:**

| **Slime** | **Diet** | **Favorite** | **Largo?** | **Location** | **Special Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Shadow** | None | N/A | NO  | Dark corners | Cannot be vacuumed up. Cannot be eaten by Tarr. Spawns in groups of 2-5. Produces plorts when hit by any thrown object (item not consumed). Jumps erratically when disturbed, then vanishes. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Twin** | Fruit | Polaricherry | YES | Throughout | Alternates blue/pink states. Can create portals to snag distant food. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Sloomber** | Meat | Candied Hen | YES | Dream Land | Emits a sleep cloud that calms or incapacitates other slimes. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Hyper** | Veg | Turbo Tater | YES | Terrarium | Extremely fast, ricochets constantly. Requires maximum corral security. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Exclusive Resources:**

- **Harvestable Nodes:** Magma Comb, Tin Petal, Black Indigonium, Aqua Glass, Dream Bubble.
- **New Foods:** Polaricherry (Fruit), Candied Hen (Meat), Turbo Tater (Vegetable).
- **Prisma Plort:** A craftable resource, '''not a slime'''. Created by processing Unstable Plorts.

**CRITICAL - Plort Storage Strategy:**

Grey Labyrinth plorts have multiple uses and should be stored carefully:

- **Prisma Plorts:**
  - Required total: ~265 (90 for Gigi's milestones + 175 for crafting upgrades)
  - **Store in SILOS, not Refinery** until you've obtained all milestone rewards from Gigi
  - Once plorts are in the Refinery, they cannot be withdrawn for trading to Gigi
  - Only deposit to Refinery when actively crafting specific upgrades

- **Shadow Plorts:**
  - Required total: 1,165 for all 25 Shadow Plort Doors, plus crafting needs (Nullifier 20, Shadow Sureshot amount TBD)
  - **Store in SILOS, not Refinery** until you've opened all desired Shadow Plort Doors
  - Shadow Plort Doors require plorts from your inventory/silos - Refinery plorts cannot be used

- **General Rule:** Never put Grey Labyrinth plorts in the Refinery until you've completed all door/milestone objectives. Use Silos for flexible storage.

#### Phase 4: The 4-Phase Operational Strategy

Execute your exploration of the Labyrinth in four distinct, strategic phases.

**Phase 1: Initial Incursion & Intelligence Gathering**

- **Objective:** Map the area and assess threats.
- **Actions:**
  - Enter the Labyrinth and immediately begin searching for Map Data Nodes. Do not proceed deep into unknown territory without a map.
  - Observe Prisma Disruption patterns but do not engage with them yet.
  - Locate the new slime species and resource nodes. Mark their positions for future, targeted runs.
  - Return to your portal and extract once the map is active.

**Phase 2: Asset Acquisition & Gordo Removal**

- **Objective:** Capture breeding stock of new slimes and unlock permanent shortcuts.
- **Actions:**
  - Conduct separate, targeted runs to capture 10-12 Twin Slimes, 10-12 Sloomber Slimes, and 10 Hyper Slimes (after solving the Terrarium puzzle). Collect their favorite foods on these runs.
  - Transport them back to pre-built corrals in The Den or The Digsite.
  - Locate and pop the three Labyrinth Gordos:
    - **Twin Gordo:** (30 Fruit) Reveals a portal to the Conservatory.
    - **Sloomber Gordo:** (30 Meat) Reveals a portal to the Terrarium.
    - **Hyper Gordo:** (30 Veggies) Reveals a key switch for progression.

**Phase 3: Mastering Disruptions & Resource Farming** **Temporary Labyrinth Pink Slime Farm Setup** To efficiently farm Prisma Plorts, you need slimes INSIDE the Labyrinth:

- **Location:** Set up near a Stabilizing Gate in the Waterworks (main hub area)
- **Setup:**
  - Bring 50 Pink Slimes from your ranch in your vac tanks
  - Place them in a temporary, open area (no corral needed)
  - Position yourself between the slimes and the nearest Stabilizing Gate
- **Operation During Disruption:**
  - Collect Unstable food (fruits, veggies, chickens)
  - Feed the Pink Slimes immediately
  - They produce Unstable Plorts
  - Walk through Stabilizing Gate with Unstable Plorts in your vac
  - They convert to stable Prisma Plorts
  - Deposit to nearby Refinery Link
- **Important:** This is NOT permanent ranching - it's a temporary extraction operation. When done farming, vacuum up the Pink Slimes and return them to your ranch or release them.
- **Objective:** Systematically farm Prisma Plorts and other rare materials.
- **Actions:**
  - **Prisma Plort Farming (Critical Process):** Prisma Plorts are a vital endgame resource created by stabilizing the effects of a Prisma Disruption.
    - **Step 1:** During a Prisma Disruption, all food and plorts become "Unstable." Collect this Unstable food.
    - **Step 2:** Feed the Unstable food to any slime (Twin Slimes in Impossible Sky work well, or bring Pink Slimes for their omnivore diet). They will produce Unstable Plorts.
    - **Step 3:** You must stabilize these Unstable Plorts QUICKLY before they randomly eject from your Vacpack. Two methods:
      - **Method 1 (Opportunistic):** Shoot or toss Unstable Plorts through yellow **Prisma Stabilizers** (floating portals that appear during disruptions). They stabilize on the other side. Note: Prisma Stabilizers are one-time use and disappear after.
      - **Method 2 (Optimal):** If you find a permanent **Stabilizing Gate** (archway structure), position near it. Walk through the gate with Unstable Plorts in your vac to stabilize them. This is repeatable.
    - **Optimal Setup (if permanent Stabilizing Gate found):** Position slimes near the gate. During disruptions, gather Unstable food, feed slimes, and immediately walk through the gate to convert Unstable Plorts into Prisma Plorts. Repeat as needed.
  - **Shadow Plort Farming:** Conduct runs with a full inventory of throwable objects to hit Shadow Slimes (they spawn in groups of 2-5 in dark corners). Systematically open the 25 Shadow Plort Doors to create a permanent network of shortcuts.
  - **Shadow Plort Doors:** Opening all 25 Shadow Plort Doors is a key objective for mastering the Grey Labyrinth, requiring 1,165 Shadow Plorts total. These doors grant access to valuable blueprints (Stabilizing Gate, teleporters, Trydro Turret), upgrade components (3 Storage Cells, Power Chips, modules), decorations, and crucial shortcuts that make navigating the massive biome significantly more efficient.
  - **Resource Harvesting:** With shortcuts open, perform efficient runs to collect Magma Comb, Tin Petal, Black Indigonium, etc., depositing them at a nearby Refinery Link.

**Phase 4: Prismacore Stabilization**

- **Objective:** Complete the main story objective and stabilize the Prismacore.
- **Story Context:** As you explore the Grey Labyrinth, you'll encounter holographic projections of **Gigi**, an NPC who communicates throughout the Labyrinth. Gigi is physically stationed at the Prismacore (the heart of the Labyrinth) and uses these holograms to guide you and explain the situation.
- **Actions:**
  - Follow Gigi's holographic guidance as you explore the Labyrinth zones
  - Use your farmed Prisma Plorts to craft the **Disruption Detector**
  - Navigate to the Prismacore at the heart of the Labyrinth to meet Gigi in person
  - At Gigi's **Prisma Plort Exchange** station, trade Prisma Plorts for milestone rewards:
    - **20 Prisma Plorts** → Nullifier blueprint (one-time reward)
    - **20 Prisma Plorts** → Storage Cell (one-time reward)
    - **50 Prisma Plorts** → Drone Station Module (one-time reward)
    - **10 Prisma Plorts** → 1 Rainbow Coin (unlimited, repeatable)
  - Find and activate all **5 Harmonizers** hidden throughout the Grey Labyrinth (shoot any item at them to activate)
  - Craft the **Nullifier** device using the blueprint obtained from Gigi
  - **Nullifier Additional Uses:** The Nullifier can be placed in unstable walls (look for door-shaped indentations with rainbow texture) to open hidden passages throughout the Grey Labyrinth. The passage remains open only while the Nullifier is placed - removing it closes the passage. Useful for accessing locked shortcuts or hidden areas.
  - Navigate to the Prismacore and enter its interior
  - **Prismacore Stabilization Process:**
    - A giant Tarr barrier surrounds the Prismacore's core
    - Use the **Slime Shower** facility: Deposit 6 slimes into either of the 2 depositing ports to break the Tarr barrier
    - Deploy the Nullifier to stabilize the Prismacore
    - Upon completion, the Prismacore becomes stabilized and Rainbow Island is saved from catastrophic reality collapse
  - **Story Resolution:** Gigi leaves the Labyrinth to reunite with her family, returning to her timeline through a portal. Most holographic pads become non-interactive (except the Prismacore pad which shows a recorded message)
  - Complete the story and unlock unlimited Rainbow Coin trading at the Prismacore Exchange Station
  - Continue trading Prisma Plorts for Rainbow Coins to purchase items from the Night Market

#### Phase 5: Integration & Final Upgrades

With Labyrinth assets secured, integrate them into your ranching empire and craft the final tier of technology. **Endgame Largo Recommendations:**

- **Twin-Hunter:** High profit and unique portal ability. Feed Roostros for a reliable 3-plort output.
- **Sloomber-Saber:** The Sloomber's sleep cloud pacifies the aggressive Saber component, making for a stable and valuable meat-eater. Requires a Music Box.
- **Hyper-Ringtail:** The highest potential profit per feeding, but extremely difficult to contain. Only for expert ranchers with fully-upgraded corrals.

**Priority Upgrades (Requires Labyrinth Materials):**

- **Power Core V:** Boosts energy to 300 (max).
- **Heart Module IV:** Boosts health to 300 (max).
- **Tank Booster V-VIII:** Increases capacity up to 100 units per slot.
- **Regenerator I & II:** Increases the rate of energy regeneration.

**Executive Summary: Labyrinth Directives**

- **Map First:** Your first priority is always to activate the Map Data Nodes. Do not operate in unmapped territory.
- **Shortcuts are Key:** Systematically farm Shadow Plorts to open all 25 Shadow Doors. This is not optional; it is critical for efficiency.
- **Master Disruptions:** Learn the Prisma Disruption cycle to farm Prisma Plorts. This is the gateway to the entire endgame economy.
- **Do Not Ranch Here:** The Labyrinth is a high-risk extraction zone, not a ranching expansion. Capture assets and transport them back to your secure, automated facilities.

### End of Chapter Completion Checklist

- **Exploration:** All Labyrinth Map Nodes activated and all zones explored.
- **Asset Acquisition:** All new Labyrinth slime species (Twin, Sloomber, Hyper) captured and established on the ranch.
- **Gordo Removal:** The Twin, Sloomber, and Hyper Gordos have been popped, unlocking all portals.
- **Resource Farming:** A stable Prisma Plort farming operation is established and all 25 Shadow Doors have been opened.
- **Story Completion:** The Prismacore has been stabilized with the Nullifier, and the Rainbow Coin exchange is unlocked.

### Next Chapter Preparation

With the main story complete and all slimes discovered, the focus shifts from progression-based objectives to creative, self-directed goals. The "how-to" is complete; what you build now is up to you. Prepare to transition your mindset from "efficiency" to "creativity."

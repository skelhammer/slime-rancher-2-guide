## Chapter 13: The Grey Labyrinth - Endgame Operations

**Mindset:** _Strategic endgame extraction._

The Grey Labyrinth is the ultimate challenge - a dangerous, high-reward zone containing the rarest slimes and materials in the game. Execute strategic objectives to extract these valuable endgame assets.

### The Operational Blueprint

#### Phase 1: Prerequisites & Initial Entry

Success in the Labyrinth is determined before you step inside. Entry is restricted, and survival demands peak equipment. This phase details the mandatory gear and the key gadget required for access: the Radiant Projector.

**Key Gadget: The Radiant Projector**

The Radiant Projector is a craftable utility gadget that acts as a mirror, allowing you to redirect beams of light. It is essential for solving the puzzles that lock the main entrance to the Grey Labyrinth and for navigating deeper within.

**How to Unlock the Radiant Projector Blueprint:**

**Blueprint Source:** Viktor Humphries (NPC scientist) gives you the blueprint via a comm station call.

**Unlock Requirements:** Viktor's call will occur automatically when you meet BOTH of these conditions:

- You have popped either the Boom Gordo (Ember Valley) OR the Flutter Gordo (Starlight Strand)
- It is at least Day 20 of your playthrough (in-game days, not real time)

**Timeline If Following This Guide:**

- Chapter 3 (Days 8-12): You pop the Boom Gordo in Ember Valley
- Chapter 4 (Days 13-17): You pop the Flutter Gordo in Starlight Strand
- Day 20: Viktor's comm station call triggers automatically
- Day 20+: Radiant Projector blueprint becomes available at your Fabricator

**Important Notes:**

Viktor's call is AUTOMATIC - you don't need to do anything special to trigger it. After receiving the call, check your Fabricator - the Radiant Projector blueprint will be unlocked. You don't need to craft Radiant Projectors immediately - wait until you're ready to enter the Grey Labyrinth (Chapter 13). The game ensures you have the blueprint well before you need it (Chapter 13 will be much later than Day 20 if following this guide).

**If Viktor Hasn't Called Yet:**

Check your current in-game day (visible on your save file timestamp). Verify you've popped at least one of the required Gordos (Boom or Flutter). If you've met both requirements and it's past Day 20, the call may trigger when you next return to the Conservatory or sleep. Viktor's calls are persistent - you cannot miss them permanently.

**Radiant Projector Crafting Recipe:**

Once unlocked, the Radiant Projector can be crafted at the Fabricator:

- Cost: 500 Newbucks
- Materials: 10 Hunter Plorts, 10 Boom Plorts, 5 Silky Sand, 5 Lava Dust
- Quantity: Craft 3-4 Radiant Projectors before entering the Grey Labyrinth
- Reusability: Radiant Projectors are placeable gadgets that can be picked up and reused, but having multiple allows you to solve complex multi-mirror puzzles without backtracking

**Prerequisite Checklist**

- **Required Vacpack Status (from Chapter 12 Audit):**
  - **Health/Energy:** Heart Module III (250 HP), Power Core III (250 Energy)
  - **Mobility:** Jetpack II, Dash Boots II
  - **Inventory/Defense:** Tank Booster III, Extra Tank, Tank Guard, Water Tank, Pulse Wave
- **Required Expedition Kit (In Inventory):**
  - **Entry Tools:** At least 3-4 crafted Radiant Projectors. While they are reusable, carrying several allows you to solve complex puzzles without having to backtrack.
  - **Puzzle Items:** A stack of Hunter Plorts and Angler Plorts.
  - **Utility:** A full stack of a throwable item (e.g., Pink Plorts) for dealing with Shadow Slimes.

**Executing Entry**

- **Entry Points:**
  - **Ember Valley:** Enter the portal revealed after popping the Boom Gordo in the western volcanic area.
  - **Starlight Strand:** Enter the portal revealed after popping the Flutter Gordo in the southern central cave.
- **Entry Puzzle:** Both routes lead to a sealed door. Use two Radiant Projectors to redirect the light beams into the door's sensors. The beam will turn YELLOW when correctly aligned, opening the path.

#### Phase 2: Labyrinth Cartography - Zones & Hazards

The Labyrinth is a massive, multi-level environment. Your first priority is understanding its layout and unique dangers. **Key Zones:**

- **Waterworks (Hub):** The central arrival area, connecting to most other zones.
- **Lava Depths:** A network of lava channels to the west, containing access to the Terrarium puzzle.
- **Dream Land:** A series of upper towers where Sloomber Slimes reside.
- **Terrarium:** A sealed biodome in the north, home to Hyper Slimes and all island vegetation.
- **Prismacore:** The final zone and the source of the Labyrinth's instability.

**Critical Hazards**

- **Prisma Disruptions:** Reality-altering energy waves that periodically sweep through the zones. They can cause gravity inversion, time dilation, or environmental damage. During a disruption, all loose food and plorts in the affected area become "Unstable."
- **Unstable Items:** An item with the "Unstable" status has a hidden timer. If it remains in your Vacpack for too long (roughly 30-60 seconds), it becomes too volatile and will be forcibly ejected. You must process these items at a **Stabilizing Gate** or **Prisma Stabilizer** before the timer runs out to convert them into usable resources.
- **No Slime Sea:** The bottom of the Labyrinth is a cloud ocean. Any slimes, items, or ranchers that fall in are PERMANENTLY LOST. There is no recovery.

#### Phase 3: Asset Identification - New Species & Resources

The Labyrinth contains the most valuable and volatile assets in the game. Identifying them is key to unlocking the final tier of upgrades. **New Slime Species:**

| **Slime** | **Diet** | **Favorite** | **Largo?** | **Location** | **Special Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Shadow** | None | N/A | NO  | Dark corners | Produces plorts when hit by any object. Flees quickly. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Twin** | Fruit | Polaricherry | YES | Throughout | Alternates blue/pink states. Can create portals to snag distant food. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Sloomber** | Meat | Candied Hen | YES | Dream Land | Emits a sleep cloud that calms or incapacitates other slimes. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Hyper** | Veg | Turbo Tater | YES | Terrarium | Extremely fast, ricochets constantly. Requires maximum corral security. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Exclusive Resources:**

- **Harvestable Nodes:** Magma Comb, Tin Petal, Black Indigonium, Aqua Glass, Dream Bubble.
- **New Foods:** Polaricherry (Fruit), Candied Hen (Meat), Turbo Tater (Vegetable).
- **Prisma Plort:** A craftable resource, '''not a slime'''. Created by processing Unstable Plorts.

#### Phase 4: The 4-Phase Operational Strategy

Execute your exploration of the Labyrinth in four distinct, strategic phases.

**Phase 1: Initial Incursion & Intelligence Gathering**

- **Objective:** Map the area and assess threats.
- **Actions:**
  - Enter the Labyrinth and immediately begin searching for Map Data Nodes. Do not proceed deep into unknown territory without a map.
  - Observe Prisma Disruption patterns but do not engage with them yet.
  - Locate the new slime species and resource nodes. Mark their positions for future, targeted runs.
  - Return to your portal and extract once the map is active.

**Phase 2: Asset Acquisition & Gordo Removal**

- **Objective:** Capture breeding stock of new slimes and unlock permanent shortcuts.
- **Actions:**
  - Conduct separate, targeted runs to capture 10-12 Twin Slimes, 10-12 Sloomber Slimes, and 10 Hyper Slimes (after solving the Terrarium puzzle). Collect their favorite foods on these runs.
  - Transport them back to pre-built corrals in The Den or The Digsite.
  - Locate and pop the three Labyrinth Gordos:
    - **Twin Gordo:** (30 Fruit) Reveals a portal to the Conservatory.
    - **Sloomber Gordo:** (30 Meat) Reveals a portal to the Terrarium.
    - **Hyper Gordo:** (30 Veggies) Reveals a key switch for progression.

**Phase 3: Mastering Disruptions & Resource Farming** **Temporary Labyrinth Pink Slime Farm Setup** To efficiently farm Prisma Plorts, you need slimes INSIDE the Labyrinth:

- **Location:** Set up near a Stabilizing Gate in the Waterworks (main hub area)
- **Setup:**
  - Bring 50 Pink Slimes from your ranch in your vac tanks
  - Place them in a temporary, open area (no corral needed)
  - Position yourself between the slimes and the nearest Stabilizing Gate
- **Operation During Disruption:**
  - Collect Unstable food (fruits, veggies, chickens)
  - Feed the Pink Slimes immediately
  - They produce Unstable Plorts
  - Walk through Stabilizing Gate with Unstable Plorts in your vac
  - They convert to stable Prisma Plorts
  - Deposit to nearby Refinery Link
- **Important:** This is NOT permanent ranching - it's a temporary extraction operation. When done farming, vacuum up the Pink Slimes and return them to your ranch or release them.
- **Objective:** Systematically farm Prisma Plorts and other rare materials.
- **Actions:**
  - **Prisma Plort Farming (Critical Process):** Prisma Plorts are a vital endgame resource created by stabilizing the effects of a Prisma Disruption.
    - **Step 1:** During a Prisma Disruption, all food and plorts become "Unstable." Collect this Unstable food.
    - **Step 2:** Feed the Unstable food to any slime (Pink Slimes are recommended for their simple diet). They will produce Unstable Plorts.
    - **Step 3:** You must stabilize these Unstable Plorts before they break out of your Vacpack. This is done in one of two ways: shoot them through a **Prisma Stabilizer** (the yellow portals) or, more efficiently, walk through a **Stabilizing Gate** while holding them in your vac.
    - **Optimal Setup:** Build a temporary corral with 50+ Pink Slimes near a Stabilizing Gate in the Labyrinth. During a disruption, gather Unstable food, feed the slimes, and immediately walk through the gate to convert the Unstable Plorts in your tank into stable, valuable Prisma Plorts.
  - **Shadow Plort Farming:** Conduct runs with a full inventory of throwable objects to hit Shadow Slimes. Systematically open the 25 Shadow Doors to create a permanent network of shortcuts.
  - **Shadow Doors:** Opening all 25 Shadow Doors is a key objective for mastering the Grey Labyrinth, requiring a total of 1,275 Shadow Plorts. These doors grant access to valuable blueprints, decorations, and crucial shortcuts that make navigating the massive biome significantly more efficient.
  - **Resource Harvesting:** With shortcuts open, perform efficient runs to collect Magma Comb, Tin Petal, Black Indigonium, etc., depositing them at a nearby Refinery Link.

**Phase 4: Prismacore Stabilization**

- **Objective:** Complete the main story objective.
- **Actions:**
  - Use your farmed Prisma Plorts to craft the **Disruption Detector** and the **Nullifier** device (blueprint from Gigi).
  - Navigate to the Prismacore at the heart of the Labyrinth.
  - Deploy the Nullifier to stabilize the core and complete the story.
  - This unlocks the **Prisma Plort Exchange**, allowing you to trade 10 Prisma Plorts for 1 Rainbow Coin.

#### Phase 5: Integration & Final Upgrades

With Labyrinth assets secured, integrate them into your ranching empire and craft the final tier of technology. **Endgame Largo Recommendations:**

- **Twin-Hunter:** High profit and unique portal ability. Feed Roostros for a reliable 3-plort output.
- **Sloomber-Saber:** The Sloomber's sleep cloud pacifies the aggressive Saber component, making for a stable and valuable meat-eater. Requires a Music Box.
- **Hyper-Ringtail:** The highest potential profit per feeding, but extremely difficult to contain. Only for expert ranchers with fully-upgraded corrals.

**Priority Upgrades (Requires Labyrinth Materials):**

- **Power Core V:** Boosts energy to 300 (max).
- **Heart Module IV:** Boosts health to 300 (max).
- **Tank Booster V-VIII:** Increases capacity up to 100 units per slot.
- **Regenerator I & II:** Increases the rate of energy regeneration.

**Executive Summary: Labyrinth Directives**

- **Map First:** Your first priority is always to activate the Map Data Nodes. Do not operate in unmapped territory.
- **Shortcuts are Key:** Systematically farm Shadow Plorts to open all 25 Shadow Doors. This is not optional; it is critical for efficiency.
- **Master Disruptions:** Learn the Prisma Disruption cycle to farm Prisma Plorts. This is the gateway to the entire endgame economy.
- **Do Not Ranch Here:** The Labyrinth is a high-risk extraction zone, not a ranching expansion. Capture assets and transport them back to your secure, automated facilities.

### End of Chapter Completion Checklist

- **Exploration:** All Labyrinth Map Nodes activated and all zones explored.
- **Asset Acquisition:** All new Labyrinth slime species (Twin, Sloomber, Hyper) captured and established on the ranch.
- **Gordo Removal:** The Twin, Sloomber, and Hyper Gordos have been popped, unlocking all portals.
- **Resource Farming:** A stable Prisma Plort farming operation is established and all 25 Shadow Doors have been opened.
- **Story Completion:** The Prismacore has been stabilized with the Nullifier, and the Rainbow Coin exchange is unlocked.

### Next Chapter Preparation

With the main story complete and all slimes discovered, the focus shifts from progression-based objectives to creative, self-directed goals. The "how-to" is complete; what you build now is up to you. Prepare to transition your mindset from "efficiency" to "creativity."

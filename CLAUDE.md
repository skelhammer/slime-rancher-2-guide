## Guide Philosophy

The guide takes an aggressive optimization approach focused on:
- **Ruthless Asset Progression**: Treating slimes as profit-generating assets
- **Capital Deployment**: Immediate reinvestment of Newbucks into infrastructure
- **Automation**: Systematically eliminating manual labor through Auto-Feeders and drones

## Writing Style

When editing this guide, maintain the following stylistic elements:

- **Directive, strategic tone**: Frames gameplay as resource management and capital deployment
- **Clear hierarchical structure**: Chapters with operational blueprints, strategic priorities, and success metrics
- **Tabular data in appendices**: Quick reference tables for game mechanics
- **Warning callouts**: CRITICAL warnings for important game mechanics (e.g., Tarr outbreaks, Prismatic Slimes)
- **Consistent formatting**: Bold for emphasis, bullet points for lists, tables for comparative data

## Version Information

The version header is located **only** in `00-introduction.md` at the top of the file:
- Current Version: 0.47 - Drone Deployment Edition
- Last Updated: October 21, 2025
- Verified against Slime Rancher 2 Version 1.0 (released September 23, 2025)
- Contains disclaimer about outdated prices/material costs due to recipe overhaul in v1.0

**Version Numbering Scheme:**
- Increment version number for each update (0.40 → 0.41 → 0.42, etc.)
- Give each version a fun, descriptive name based on what changed
- Examples: "The Price is Right Edition" (price fixes), "Largo Optimization Edition" (new combos), "Spring Cleaning Edition" (reorganization)

## Common Editing Tasks

When updating this guide, common tasks include:

- Updating prices and material costs when new patch information becomes available
- Adding new slimes, biomes, or mechanics from game updates
- Correcting inaccurate location descriptions or resource costs
- Expanding appendices with newly discovered resources or strategies

### Version Update Process

**IMPORTANT:** When making ANY changes to the guide:

1. Edit the appropriate chapter file (`01-chapter-01.md`, `03-chapter-09.md`, `appendix-slimes.md`, `plot-overview.md`, etc.)
2. Update **ONLY** `00-introduction.md` with:
   - Incremented version number (e.g., 0.40 → 0.41)
   - Current date in "Last Updated" field
   - Fun, descriptive version name reflecting the change
3. Do NOT update version info in individual chapter files - it only lives in `00-introduction.md`

**Version Header Format:**
```markdown
#### Version 0.XX - Descriptive Name Edition

**Last Updated: Month Day, Year**
```

**Note:** When updating `plot-overview.md`, also update the version in `00-introduction.md` as this file is part of the main guide content.

## Working with Individual Chapter Files

The guide has been split into individual chapter files for easier editing:

- **When editing a specific chapter**: Edit the corresponding chapter file (e.g., `01-chapter-01.md` for Chapter 1, `03-chapter-09.md` for Chapter 9)
- **When editing core mechanics**: Edit `00-introduction.md`
- **When editing reference tables**: Edit the appropriate appendix file:
  - Slime/Gordo data: `appendix-slimes.md`
  - Food/Items/Resources: `appendix-items.md`
  - Upgrades/Costs: `appendix-upgrades.md`
  - Treasure Pods/Drones/Doors: `appendix-locations.md`
- **When editing ranch progression tables**: Edit `plot-overview.md`
- **File naming convention**:
  - Chapters: `[part-number]-chapter-[chapter-number].md` (e.g., `01-chapter-01.md`, `02-chapter-05.md`)
  - Core files: `00-introduction.md`, `plot-overview.md`
  - Appendices: `appendix-[category].md` (e.g., `appendix-slimes.md`, `appendix-items.md`)
- **Benefits of this structure**:
  - Much faster file loading and editing (very small, focused files)
  - Minimal context usage when making targeted edits to specific chapters
  - Easy to navigate directly to the chapter you need to edit
  - Better organization for version control and tracking chapter-specific changes
  - Each chapter can be edited independently without loading entire parts
  - `plot-overview.md` provides quick table reference without reading full chapters
  - Appendices split into 4 focused files to avoid token limits and improve performance

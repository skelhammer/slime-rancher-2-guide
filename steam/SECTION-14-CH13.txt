[hr][/hr]

[h3]The Operational Blueprint[/h3]

This chapter is about opening all 25 Shadow Plort Doors and stockpiling resources needed for Prismacore stabilization.

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Phase 1: Shadow Plort Door Completion[/h3]

[b]Objective:[/b] Open all 25 Shadow Plort Doors (1,165 Shadow Plorts total)

[b]Shadow Plort Farming Strategy:[/b]
[list]
[*]Shadow Slimes spawn in groups of 2-5 in dark corners throughout Grey Labyrinth
[*]Hit them with ANY thrown object (Pink Plorts, vegetables, anything)
[*]They drop Shadow Plorts, then vanish
[*]Respawn in same dark corner locations
[*]Total needed: 1,185 Shadow Plorts (1,165 for doors + 20 for Nullifier)
[*][b]CRITICAL:[/b] Store in SILOS, not Refinery (cannot use Refinery plorts for doors)
[/list]

[b]Door Cost Breakdown:[/b]
[list]
[*]Costs range from 25-100 Shadow Plorts per door
[*]Total for all 25 doors: 1,165 Shadow Plorts
[*]Priority Doors (open first): 25 & 50 plort doors for shortcuts and quality-of-life
[/list]

[h3]Phase 2: Prisma Plort Stockpiling[/h3]

[b]Objective:[/b] Stockpile ~245 Prisma Plorts total

[b]Prisma Plort Uses:[/b]
[list]
[*]90 for Gigi's milestone trades (Chapter 14)
[*]155 for crafting upgrades (145 Vacpack + 10 Disruption Detector)
[/list]

[b]Prisma Plort Farming Strategy:[/b]
[list]
[*]During Prisma Disruptions, all food becomes "Unstable"
[*]Feed Unstable food to any slimes → produces Unstable Plorts
[*]Walk through Ancient Stabilizer → Unstable Plorts automatically convert to Prisma Plorts in inventory
[*]Conversion rate: 1 Unstable → 1-2 Prisma Plorts (typically 2)
[*][b]CRITICAL:[/b] Store in SILOS, not Refinery (cannot trade Refinery plorts to Gigi)
[/list]

[b]Optimal Farming Setup:[/b]
[list]
[*]Temporary Pink Slime operation near Ancient Stabilizer in Grey Labyrinth
[*]Collect Unstable food during disruption
[*]Feed Pink Slimes → Unstable Plorts
[*]Walk through Ancient Stabilizer → conversion to Prisma Plorts
[*]Deposit to portable Refinery Link or return to ranch
[*]Avoid standing near ground cracks during disruptions (plasma/flame geysers)
[/list]

[list]
[*][b]Heart Module IV[/b] (10,000 NB + materials)
[*][b]Power Core V[/b] (15,000 NB + materials)
[*][b]Tank Booster V[/b] (15,000 NB + materials)

[*]Grey Labyrinth resource nodes (Magma Comb, Tin Petal, Black Indigonium, Aqua Glass, Dream Bubble, Royal Jelly)
[*]Chapter 11-12 slime operations (Twin, Sloomber, Hyper, Ringtail plorts)

[h3]Phase 4: Craft Disruption Detector[/h3]

[b]Blueprint:[/b] Obtained from Gigi in Impossible Sky area

[b]Recipe:[/b] 500 NB + 10 Prisma Plorts + 5 Tin Petal + 5 Dream Bubble

[b]Usage:[/b] Place in Grey Labyrinth to add map pins showing disruption status:
[list]
[*]White icon = No disruption
[*]Yellow icon = Upcoming disruption
[*]Red icon = Disruption ongoing
[/list]

This helps optimize Prisma Plort farming timing.

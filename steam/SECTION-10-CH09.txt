[hr][/hr]

[h3]Financial Checkpoint[/h3]

[list]

[*][b]Capital Required:[/b] ~15,000 NB for 3 Quantum Drone Stations
[*][b]Materials Required:[/b] 300 Flutter Plorts, 6 Strange Diamonds, 45 Lava Dust, 45 Wild Honey
[*][b]Time Savings:[/b] Daily ranch management reduced from 30+ minutes to <10 minutes
[*][b]Timeline:[/b] 3-5 days through all operations
[/list]

[h3]Phase 1: Finding Ghostly Drones[/h3]

[b]What Are Ghostly Drones?[/b]
Ethereal, semi-transparent phantom drones that roam Rainbow Island. Interact with one to receive a Drone Station Module, then it disappears permanently.

[b]Easiest 3 Locations (for Chapter 9):[/b]
[list]
[*][b]First Ranch Expansion:[/b] 1 Ghostly Drone in whichever expansion you unlocked first (Gully, Archway, or Den)
[*][b]The Tidepools:[/b] 1 Ghostly Drone spawn
[*][b]Starlight Strand:[/b] By the big two-colored tree (pink/blue biome junction)
[/list]

[b]How to Capture:[/b]
[olist]
[*]Approach the Ghostly Drone (within 5 meters)
[*]Press interact button
[*]Receive 1 Drone Station Module
[*]Drone disappears permanently
[/olist]

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Phase 2: Crafting Quantum Drone Stations[/h3]

[b]Recipe Per Station:[/b]
[list]
[*]5,000 Newbucks
[*]100 Flutter Plorts
[*]15 Lava Dust
[*]15 Wild Honey
[*]2 Strange Diamonds
[*]1 Drone Station Module
[/list]

[b]Total for 3 Stations:[/b] 15,000 NB + 300 Flutter Plorts + 45 Lava Dust + 45 Wild Honey + 6 Strange Diamonds + 3 Drone Station Modules

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Phase 3: Priority Drone Deployments[/h3]

[b]Drone 1 - Conservatory Automation (HIGHEST PRIORITY):[/b]
[list]
[*]Station Location: Conservatory central area
[*]Programming:
  - Target: Plorts
  - Source: Plort Collector
  - Destination: Plort Market (immediate sales) OR Silo (price spike management)
[*]Result: Continuously collects ALL plorts from ALL 4 corrals
[*]Expected Result: 3,000-4,000+ NB/day with minimal intervention
[*]Battery: Charge with Pink/Cotton Plorts (20-30 plorts = weeks of operation)
[/list]

[b]Drone 2 - Gully Plort Collection:[/b]
[list]
[*]Station Location: The Gully central area
[*]Programming:
  - Target: Plorts
  - Source: Plort Collector
  - Destination: Plort Market OR Silo
[*]Result: Continuously collects plorts from both corrals (Angler-Crystal, Saber-Hunter)
[*]Expected Result: 2,000-3,000+ NB/day automated
[*]Battery: Charge with Crystal/Hunter Plorts (15-20 plorts = weeks)
[/list]

[b]Drone 3 - Tidepools Passive Income Automation:[/b]
[list]
[*]Station Location: The Tidepools central area
[*]Programming:
  - Target: Plorts
  - Source: Plort Collector
  - Destination: Plort Market OR Silo
[*]Result: Continuously collects plorts from Puddle Ponds and Fire Incinerators
[*]Expected Result: 1,540-2,310 NB/day with ZERO manual intervention
[*]Battery: Charge with Pink Plorts (10-15 plorts = weeks)
[/list]

[h3]How Quantum Drones Work[/h3]

[b]Two Operating Modes:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Rancher Mode[/b] (Placed in ranch expansions):
  - Program with Target → Source → Destination logic
  - Instantly teleports between locations
  - Handles all ranch automation
[*][b]Explorer Mode[/b] (Placed in wild biomes):
  - Generates "quantum" resources based on biome
  - Deposits into shared Quantum Cloud inventory (max 9,999 items)
  - Passive resource generation while away
[/list]

[b]Battery System:[/b]
[list]
[*]Runs on plorts: 0%-100% (green bar) with overcharge to 999% (golden bar)
[*]Initial battery: 24%
[*]Higher battery % = faster operation speed
[*]Battery only drains during active task execution
[*]Picking up station resets battery to 24%
[/list]

[b]Important Limitations:[/b]
[list]
[*]Drones only work within same expansion (cannot transfer between Conservatory/Gully/etc.)
[*]Food to Auto-Feeders goes to ALL feeders randomly (loses favorite food bonuses)
[*][b]Recommendation:[/b] Use drones ONLY for plort collection, manually feed for 4-plort bonus
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Strategic Priorities[/h3]

[olist]
[*][b]Hunt 3 Ghostly Drones:[/b] Locate in ranch expansions to obtain Drone Station Modules
[*][b]Accumulate 300 Flutter Plorts:[/b] From Chapter 8 operations (DO NOT purchase)
[*][b]Gather Strange Diamonds:[/b] Collect 6 from Starlight Strand treasure pods
[*][b]Craft 3 Quantum Drone Stations:[/b] Build for ranch automation
[*][b]Deploy Conservatory Drone:[/b] HIGHEST PRIORITY - automate largest, most valuable operation
[*][b]Deploy Gully Drone:[/b] Automate carnivore plort collection
[*][b]Deploy Tidepools Drone:[/b] Fully automate passive income
[/olist]

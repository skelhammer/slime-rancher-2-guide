[h2]Chapter 5: The Gully Industrial Core[/h2]

[b]Primary Objective:[/b] Construct a self-sufficient protein production facility and centralized food distribution network

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Financial Checkpoint[/h3]

[list]
[*][b]Starting Budget:[/b] 15,000-20,000+ NB from Chapter 4
[*][b]Capital Required:[/b] ~13,720 NB total
  - Gully unlock: 2,800 NB
  - Full build-out: 10,920 NB
[*][b]Revenue Impact:[/b] ~4,000-4,500 NB/day (increased from ~2,500)
[*][b]Daily Increase:[/b] +1,500-2,000 NB/day
[*][b]Timeline:[/b] 5-7 days through Conservatory operations

[h3]Phase 1: The Gully Build (5 Plots)[/h3]

[b]Plot 1 - Stony Hen Coop:[/b]
[list]
[*]Coop + High Walls + Spring Grass + Vitamizer = 1,375 NB
[*]Stock: 6-8 hens + 2 roostros
[*]Purpose: Primary protein (Tabby favorite)
[/list]

[b]Plot 2 - Sea Hen Coop:[/b]
[list]
[*]Coop + High Walls + Spring Grass + Vitamizer = 1,375 NB
[*]Stock: 6-8 hens + 2 roostros
[*]Purpose: Specialized protein (Angler favorite)
[/list]

[b]Plot 3 - Central Silo:[/b]
[list]
[*]Silo + Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 = 2,175 NB
[*]Purpose: 12 storage slots for ranch-wide food distribution
[/list]

[b]Plot 4 - Angler-Crystal Largos:[/b]
[list]
[*]Corral + High Walls + Air Net + Plort Collector + Auto-Feeder + Music Box = 2,785 NB
[*]Feed Sea Hens (Angler favorite) = 4 plorts per feeding
[*]Revenue: ~1,500-2,000 NB/day
[/list]

[b]Plot 5 - Flutter-Tabby Largos:[/b]
[list]
[*]Corral + High Walls + Air Net + Solar Shield + Plort Collector + Auto-Feeder + Music Box = 3,210 NB
[*]Feed Stony Hens (Tabby favorite) = 4 plorts per feeding
[*][b]DO NOT SELL Flutter Plorts[/b] - Need 300+ for Chapter 9 Quantum Drones
[/list]

[b]Total Investment:[/b] 2,800 NB (unlock) + 10,920 NB (build) = 13,720 NB

[h3]Phase 2: Key Notes[/h3]

[b]Auto-Feeder Setup:[/b]
[list]
[*]Plot 4 (Angler-Crystal): Sea Hens
[*]Plot 5 (Flutter-Tabby): Stony Hens
[/list]

[b]CRITICAL - Flutter Plorts:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]DO NOT SELL[/b] - Need 300+ for Chapter 9 Quantum Drones
[*]Deposit into Refinery for storage
[*]Flutter-Tabby operation produces critical plorts for future automation
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Strategic Priorities[/h3]

[olist]
[*][b]Unlock The Gully:[/b] Purchase expansion (2,800 NB) from eastern Conservatory
[*][b]Build Protein Infrastructure:[/b] Two chicken coops for sustainable meat production
[*][b]Establish Central Silo:[/b] 12-slot Silo for ranch-wide food distribution
[*][b]Deploy Angler-Crystal Largos:[/b] High-value plort production with Sea Hens
[*][b]Deploy Flutter-Tabby Largos:[/b] CRITICAL - produces Flutter Plorts for Quantum Drones
[*][b]Stockpile Flutter Plorts:[/b] Deposit in Refinery, target 300+ for Chapter 9
[*][b]Install Auto-Feeders:[/b] Automate feeding for both corrals
[/olist]

[h3]Next Chapter Preparation[/h3]

Chapter 6 unlocks The Tidepools expansion and establishes passive income with Puddle and Fire Slimes.

[b]Financial Goal:[/b] Save 10,500 NB for Tidepools unlock (6,000 NB) + build-out (4,350 NB)

[b]Asset Acquisition:[/b] Collect Puddle Slimes (8 total) from Starlight Strand and Fire Slimes (10 total) from Ember Valley lava pools

[b]Upgrade Prep:[/b] Stockpile materials for Tier III upgrades (Tank Booster III, Power Core III, Heart Module III, Tank Guard II)

[b]Flutter Plorts:[/b] Continue accumulating from Flutter-Tabby operation. DO NOT SELL

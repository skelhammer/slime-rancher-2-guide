[hr][/hr]

[h3]Phase 4: Activate the 5 Harmonizers[/h3]

[b]Location:[/b] Hidden throughout Grey Labyrinth zones

[b]Activation:[/b] Shoot any item at each Harmonizer to activate it (fruits, vegetables, plorts, chickens—anything works)

[b]Harmonizer Locations:[/b]
Distributed across Grey Labyrinth zones. Explore each area systematically:
[list]
[*]Prismacore Surroundings - Check gilded areas near core
[*]Dream Land zones (East, West, Central) - Look for elevated platforms and hidden alcoves
[*]Impossible Sky zones - Explore vertical structures and floating platforms
[*]The Mirage - Search desert-like areas with unstable terrain
[*]Shifting Caverns - Check cave systems and tunnels
[/list]

[b]Search Strategy:[/b]
[list]
[*]Harmonizers emit a faint glow and distinctive sound when nearby
[*]Use your map to track which zones you've thoroughly explored
[*]Some require platforming or navigating around Stabilizers
[/list]

[b]Status Tracking:[/b] The game tracks how many Harmonizers you've activated. You must activate all 5 before you can stabilize the Prismacore.

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Phase 5: Prismacore Stabilization[/h3]

[b]The Tarr Barrier:[/b]
[list]
[*]Giant Tarr barrier surrounds Prismacore's core
[*]Cannot be crossed or destroyed with water
[/list]

[b]The Slime Shower:[/b]
Large facility inside Prismacore designed to break the Tarr barrier. Requires slime sacrifice to activate.
[list]
[*][b]Two depositing ports:[/b] Choose either one (both work identically)
[*][b]Requirement:[/b] Deposit 6 slimes total into a single port
[*][b]Any slime type works:[/b] Pink, Rock, Phosphor, Largos—doesn't matter
[*][b]Source options:[/b]
  - Bring 6 slimes from your ranch (vacpack them up before entering)
  - Catch 6 wild slimes in Grey Labyrinth zones
  - Mix of both sources
[/list]

[b]Activation Process:[/b]
[olist]
[*]Approach either depositing port
[*]Shoot 6 slimes into the port (they will be absorbed)
[*]The Slime Shower activates automatically
[*]The Tarr barrier dissolves, revealing path to Prismacore core
[/olist]

[b]Strategic Note:[/b] Using wild slimes from the Labyrinth is more efficient than bringing your valuable ranch largos. Pink slimes and common wild slimes work perfectly.

[b]Nullifier Deployment:[/b]
[list]
[*]After Tarr barrier is broken, approach the Prismacore core
[*]Deploy the Nullifier device
[*][b]Cutscene:[/b] Rainbow Island stabilizes, Prisma Disruptions cease
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Phase 6: Story Resolution[/h3]

[b]Gigi's Departure:[/b]
[list]
[*]After stabilization, Gigi leaves to reunite with her family, then returns to her own timeline
[*]She will never be seen again after leaving
[*]Most holographic pads become non-interactive
[*]Prismacore holographic pad remains functional, showing recorded farewell message
[/list]

[b]World Changes:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Prismacore stabilized:[/b] All readings normalized, Rainbow Island's future secured
[*][b]Prisma disruption persists:[/b] Effects will last for a long time before fully recovering
[*][b]Stabilizers remain necessary:[/b] Ancient Stabilizers in Labyrinth zones stay active
[/list]

[b]Post-Game Unlocks:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Unlimited Rainbow Coin trading:[/b] 10 Prisma Plorts → 1 Rainbow Coin (repeatable forever)
[*][b]Night Market access:[/b] Spend Rainbow Coins at ProntoMart for exclusive upgrades and decorations
[*][b]Grey Labyrinth exploration:[/b] Remains fully accessible for resource farming
[*][b]Prismatic decorations:[/b] New ranch customization options via Night Market

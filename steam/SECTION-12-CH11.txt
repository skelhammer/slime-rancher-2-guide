  - Archway unlock: 2,800 NB
  - Full build-out: 9,845 NB
[*][b]Revenue Impact:[/b] ~8,500-12,000 NB/day (increased from ~8,500)
[*][b]Daily Increase:[/b] +2,000-3,500 NB/day
[*][b]ROI:[/b] ~4.6 days to break even

[h3]Phase 1: The Archway Build (5 Plots)[/h3]

[b]Plot 1 - Polaricherry Garden:[/b]
[list]
[*]Garden + Nutrient Soil + Sprinkler = 1,550 NB
[*]Feeds Plot 2
[*]Polaricherry from Grey Labyrinth (20 per harvest)
[/list]

[b]Plot 2 - Twin-Flutter Largos:[/b]
[list]
[*]Corral + High Walls + Auto-Feeder + Plort Collector = 2,010 NB
[*]Feed Polaricherry (Twin favorite) = 4 plorts per feeding
[*]Revenue: ~100-150 NB/feeding
[*]Flutter calming aura, Twin portals grab distant food
[/list]

[b]Plot 3 - Candied Hen Coop:[/b]
[list]
[*]Coop + High Walls + Spring Grass + Vitamizer = 1,750 NB
[*]Stock: 6-8 hens + 2 roostros
[*]Feeds Plot 4
[/list]

[b]Plot 4 - Sloomber-Saber Largos:[/b]
[list]
[*]Corral + High Walls + Music Box + Auto-Feeder + Plort Collector = 2,360 NB
[*]Feed Candied Hens (Sloomber favorite) = 4 plorts per feeding
[*]Revenue: ~150-250 NB/feeding
[*][b]HIGHEST VALUE COMBO IN GAME[/b]
[*]Music Box CRITICAL - Sloomber clouds pacify Saber
[/list]

[b]Plot 5 - Silo:[/b]
[list]
[*]Silo + Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 = 2,175 NB
[*]Store Twin, Sloomber, Saber, Flutter plorts + food buffer
[*]DO NOT put Grey Labyrinth plorts in Refinery yet (needed Ch 13-14)
[/list]

[b]Total Investment:[/b] 2,800 NB (unlock) + 9,845 NB (build) = 12,645 NB

[h3]Phase 2: Key Notes[/h3]

[b]Auto-Feeder Setup:[/b]
[list]
[*]Plot 2 (Twin-Flutter): Polaricherry
[*]Plot 4 (Sloomber-Saber): Candied Hens
[/list]

[b]CRITICAL:[/b]
[list]
[*]Music Box on Sloomber-Saber corral is essential (Saber aggression + Sloomber sleep clouds)
[*]Use Quantum Drones (from Chapter 9) to automate plort/food transport if desired
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Strategic Priorities[/h3]

[olist]
[*][b]Unlock The Archway:[/b] Purchase expansion (2,800 NB) from northwest corner of Conservatory
[*][b]Deploy Twin-Flutter Largos:[/b] Establish high-value operation with premium Grey Labyrinth slimes
[*][b]Deploy Sloomber-Saber Largos:[/b] HIGHEST-VALUE COMBO in game (150-250 NB per feeding)
[*][b]Install Music Box:[/b] CRITICAL - Sloomber clouds pacify aggressive Saber behavior
[*][b]Build Candied Hen Coop:[/b] Establish breeding program for Sloomber favorite food
[*][b]Plant Polaricherry Garden:[/b] Grow Twin favorite food for maximum plort production
[*][b]Stockpile Grey Labyrinth Plorts:[/b] Reserve Twin, Sloomber, Saber plorts in Silo for Chapters 13-14
[/olist]

[h3]Next Chapter Preparation[/h3]

The Digsite expansion is OPTIONAL. If you've collected Dervish and Tangle slimes from weather events, Chapter 12 provides a home for them.

[b]If you haven't collected weather slimes or don't care about them, skip Chapter 12 entirely and proceed to Chapter 13 (The Endgame Audit).[/b]

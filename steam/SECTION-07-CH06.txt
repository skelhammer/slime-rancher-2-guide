[h3]Financial Checkpoint[/h3]

[list]
[*][b]Starting Budget:[/b] 25,000-30,000+ NB from Chapter 5
[*][b]Capital Required:[/b] ~24,350 NB total
  - Tidepools unlock: 6,000 NB
  - Build-out: 4,350 NB
  - Tier III upgrades: 14,000 NB
[*][b]Revenue Impact:[/b] ~5,540-6,810 NB/day (increased from ~4,500)
[*][b]Passive Income:[/b] +1,540-2,310 NB/day with only 10-15 min management
[*][b]Timeline:[/b] 5-7 days through all operations
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Phase 1: The Tidepools Build (5 Plots)[/h3]

[b]Plot 1 & 2 - Puddle Ponds:[/b]
[list]
[*]Pond (450 NB each) × 2 = 900 NB
[*]4 Puddle Slimes per pond (8 total)
[*]Zero-maintenance passive income - generates plorts from water
[/list]

[b]Plot 3 & 4 - Fire Incinerators:[/b]
[list]
[*]Incinerator + Ash Trough (950 NB each) × 2 = 1,900 NB
[*]5 Fire Slimes per incinerator (10 total)
[*]Low-maintenance income - feed ash from vegetables
[/list]

[b]Plot 5 - Ash Production Garden:[/b]
[list]
[*]Garden + Nutrient Soil + Sprinkler = 1,550 NB
[*]Plant Odd Onions (or any veggie)
[*]Throw vegetables into incinerators to generate ash
[/list]

[b]Total Investment:[/b] 6,000 NB (unlock) + 4,350 NB (build) = 10,350 NB

[h3]Phase 2: Tier III Upgrades (MANDATORY for Chapter 7)[/h3]

[b]CRITICAL - Required Before Powderfall Bluffs:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Tank Booster III[/b] (3,000 NB + materials) - 40 → 50 units per slot
[*][b]Power Core III[/b] (3,000 NB + materials) - 200 → 250 Energy
[*][b]Heart Module III[/b] (3,000 NB + materials) - 200 → 250 HP
[*][b]Tank Guard II[/b] (5,000 NB + materials) - Salvages 40% on damage
[/list]

[b]Total Investment:[/b] ~14,000 NB + materials

[b]Why MANDATORY:[/b] Chapter 7 (Powderfall Bluffs) contains aggressive Saber Slimes requiring maximum defensive capability.

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Strategic Priorities[/h3]

[olist]
[*][b]Unlock Tidepools:[/b] Purchase expansion (6,000 NB) from far end of Gully
[*][b]Deploy Puddle Ponds:[/b] 8 slimes total for zero-maintenance plort generation
[*][b]Deploy Fire Incinerators:[/b] 10 Fire Slimes for low-maintenance income
[*][b]Build Ash Garden:[/b] Plant vegetables to generate ash for Fire Slimes
[*][b]Craft Tier III Upgrades:[/b] CRITICAL - required for Chapter 7 Powderfall Bluffs survival
[*][b]Establish Passive Income:[/b] 1,540-2,310 NB/day requiring only 10-15 min management
[*][b]Zero Tarr Risk:[/b] Puddle and Fire Slimes cannot create Tarr

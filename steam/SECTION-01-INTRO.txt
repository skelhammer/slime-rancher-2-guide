[h2]Introduction: The Rancher's Mindset[/h2]

Welcome, Rancher. You've arrived on Rainbow Island with a Vacpack and a dream. This isn't a cozy farming sim - this is high-stakes resource management where every decision compounds into exponential growth or stagnation.

This guide transforms Rainbow Island into a hyper-efficient, multi-million Newbuck profit engine. Every action is a calculated investment governed by cost-benefit analysis.

[b]Deploy capital aggressively. Automate relentlessly. Dominate the market.[/b]

[h2]Core Mechanics: Understanding the Fundamentals[/h2]

[h3]The Plort Market: Supply, Demand, and Price Manipulation[/h3]

The plort market operates on dynamic supply and demand. Flood the market with one plort type, expect prices to crash next day.

[b]Strategic Implications:[/b]
[list]
[*]Diversify plort production across multiple slime types
[*]Sell balanced mix daily to avoid market saturation
[*]Advanced: Hoard one plort type while flooding others, sell during price spikes
[/list]

[h3]Largo Slimes: Exponential Profit Through Combination[/h3]

Largos form when a slime eats a different species' plort. Largos produce [b]BOTH plort types[/b] when fed.

[b]The Mathematics:[/b]
[list]
[*]Base slime + normal food = 1 plort (~10 NB)
[*]Base slime + favorite food = 2 plorts (same type, ~20 NB)
[*]Largo + normal food = 2 plorts (one each type, ~30-50 NB)
[*][b]Largo + favorite food = 4 plorts total (2 of each type, 60-150+ NB)[/b]
[/list]

[b]A properly fed Largo quadruples profit per feeding compared to base slimes.[/b]

[h3]CRITICAL WARNING: Tarr Outbreaks and Prevention[/h3]

[b]IF A LARGO EATS A THIRD PLORT TYPE[/b] (not one it produces), it transforms into a [b]Tarr[/b] - a hostile slime that devours other slimes and ranchers. Tarr produce MORE Tarr when consuming slimes, leading to catastrophic ranch-wide outbreaks in minutes.

[b]Mandatory Prevention:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Plort Collectors are MANDATORY on every corral[/b]
[*]They auto-vacuum plorts before slimes can eat them
[*]ALWAYS install before leaving slimes unattended
[*]A single missed plort = total ranch failure
[/list]

[b]Emergency Response:[/b]
[list]
[*]Water kills Tarr instantly (use Water Tank upgrade)
[*]Contain outbreaks immediately - every second counts
[*]Consider sacrificing infected corrals (vacuum into Slime Sea)
[/list]

[h3]The Agitation System: Managing Slime Behavior[/h3]

All slimes have hidden agitation value affecting behavior and productivity.

[b]How Agitation Works:[/b]
[list]
[*]Builds when slimes reach 99% hunger
[*]Takes ~12 in-game hours to reach maximum
[*]High agitation = negative behaviors:
  - Rock slimes roll more (contact damage)
  - Boom slimes explode more (launch plorts everywhere)
  - Crystal slimes produce damaging spikes
  - [b]Hunter Largos revert to feral state (hostile)[/b]
[/list]

[b]Agitation Management:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Feeding[/b]: ONLY way to permanently reset agitation to zero
[*][b]Music Box[/b] (350 NB): Halves agitation growth rate
[*][b]Slime Toys[/b]: Reduce growth by 12.5% (25% for favorites)
[*][b]Auto-Feeders[/b] (900 NB): BEST SOLUTION - auto-dispense food on timer
[/list]

[h3]Optimal Corral Population[/h3]

Overcrowding causes agitation and reduced production.

[b]Sweet Spot:[/b]
[list]
[*]8-10 regular slimes per fully upgraded corral
[*]5-6 Largos per fully upgraded corral
[/list]

More slimes ≠ more profit. It means chaos.

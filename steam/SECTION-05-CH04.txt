[h3]Phase 1: Gordo Strategy[/h3]

[b]Pop All 5 Starlight Strand Gordos:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Hunter Gordo[/b] (50 Meat) → Azure Bushes + slime doorway shortcut + 12 Hunter Slimes

[*][b]Flutter Gordo[/b] (15 Moondew Nectar ONLY) → Research Drone + Teleporter + Grey Labyrinth gate + 12 Flutter Slimes
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Phase 2: Asset Acquisition for Chapter 5[/h3]

[b]Slimes Needed:[/b]
[list]
[*]10-12 Angler Slimes (coastal areas - pop Angler Gordo for 12 free)
[*]10-12 Flutter Slimes (southern pink biome - pop Flutter Gordo for 12 free)
[*]6 Crystal Plorts (for Angler-Crystal Largos in Chapter 5)
[*]6 Tabby Plorts (for Flutter-Tabby Largos in Chapter 5)
[/list]

[b]Food Stockpile:[/b]
[list]
[*]30+ Moondew Nectar (glowing blue flowers NIGHT ONLY: 5PM-6AM) - CRITICAL for Flutter operations
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Phase 3: Tier II Upgrades[/h3]

[b]Core Upgrades (delayed from Chapter 3):[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Tank Booster II[/b] (1,000 NB + materials + Storage Cell) - 30 → 40 units per slot
[*][b]Heart Module II[/b] (1,000 NB + materials + Heart Cell) - 150 → 200 HP
[*][b]Jetpack II[/b] (1,500 NB + materials + Jetpack Drive) - 20% less energy consumption
[/list]

[b]Utility Upgrades:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Pulse Wave[/b] (450 NB + 10 Flutter Plort + materials) - Push slimes away
[*][b]Dash Boots II[/b] (1,500 NB + materials + Dash Boot Module) - Enhanced sprint efficiency
[*][b]Tank Guard[/b] (1,500 NB + materials + Tank Liner) - Salvages 20% on damage
[/list]

[b]Total Investment:[/b] ~7,850 NB + materials

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Phase 4: Critical Resources[/h3]

[b]Harvest These Materials:[/b]
[list]
[*]50+ Buzz Wax (common throughout)
[*]50+ Wild Honey (hives on trees/cliffs)
[*]30+ Moondew Nectar (NIGHT ONLY - 5PM-6AM) - [b]CRITICAL[/b]
[*]20-30 Sea Hens (coastal areas - Angler favorite)
[*]20-30 Mint Mangos (pink biome - Honey favorite)
[/list]

[b]CRITICAL:[/b] Moondew Nectar only spawns at night (5 PM - 6 AM) in glowing blue flowers. Despawns at dawn. Stockpile 30+ immediately.

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Phase 5: Warp Infrastructure[/h3]

[b]Deploy in Starlight Strand:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Refinery Link[/b] (250 NB + materials) - Junction between pink/blue biomes
[*][b]Starlight Strand Portal[/b] (2,000 NB + materials) - One-way to Starlight Strand
[*][b]Green Home Portal[/b] (1,000 NB + materials) - One-way to Conservatory
[/list]

[b]Strategic Rationale:[/b] HIGHEST-priority portal due to Flutter operations requiring regular Moondew Nectar collection (only spawns at night 5 PM - 6 AM). Essential for maintaining Flutter Plort accumulation (300+ needed for Chapter 9 Quantum Drones).

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Strategic Priorities[/h3]

[olist]
[*][b]Map First:[/b] Activate all 3 Map Data Nodes (Southern Cliff, Mushroom Forest, Southern Coast)
[*][b]Pop All 5 Gordos:[/b] Unlock shortcuts, treasure pods, receive free slimes
[*][b]Collect Moondew Nectar:[/b] CRITICAL - only spawns 5 PM - 6 AM, stockpile 30+
[*][b]Priority Treasure Pods:[/b] Tank Liner #1, Dash Boot Module, Starlight Portal blueprint
[*][b]Capture Key Slimes:[/b] 10-12 Angler, 10-12 Flutter for Chapter 5 Gully operations
[*][b]Deploy Warp Infrastructure:[/b] Portal system for Moondew Nectar farming efficiency
[*][b]Complete Tier II Upgrades:[/b] All six upgrades for improved survivability
[/olist]

[h3]Next Chapter Preparation[/h3]

Chapter 5 unlocks The Gully expansion and transforms it into a food production powerhouse.

[b]Financial Goal:[/b] Save 10,000+ NB for Gully unlock (2,800 NB) + build-out

[b]Asset Acquisition:[/b] Collect chicken breeding stock:
[list]
[*]8-10 Stony Hens (Ember Valley)
[*]8-10 Sea Hens (Starlight Strand coastal areas)
[*]4 Roostros (breeding males - 2 per coop)
[/list]

[b]Flutter Plort Accumulation:[/b] Begin stockpiling in Refinery. DO NOT SELL - needed for Chapter 9 Quantum Drones (300+ target)

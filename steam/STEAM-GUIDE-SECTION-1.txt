[h2]Introduction: The Rancher's Mindset[/h2]

Welcome, Rancher. You've just arrived on Rainbow Island with nothing but a Vacpack and a dream. This isn't your typical farming simulator where you tend a cozy homestead - this is a high-stakes resource management operation where every decision compounds into either exponential growth or stagnation.

This guide is built for ranchers who want to transform the wilds of Rainbow Island into a hyper-efficient, multi-million Newbuck profit engine.

[h3]Three Core Principles[/h3]

[olist]
[*][b]Ruthless Asset Progression[/b]: Your slimes are assets, not pets. Underperforming species must be liquidated to make way for those with higher profit yields. Market performance is the only metric that matters.
[*][b]Capital Must Be Deployed[/b]: Newbucks are capital, not a score. Every coin must be immediately reinvested into infrastructure that provides a clear and rapid return on investment (ROI).
[*][b]Automate Everything[/b]: Your time is the single most valuable resource on the ranch. The primary objective is to make your own labor obsolete through Auto-Feeders and Quantum Drones.

[h2]Core Mechanics: Master These First[/h2]

[h3]The Plort Market: Supply & Demand[/h3]

The plort market operates on dynamic supply and demand. Flooding the market with one plort type crashes its price the next day.

[b]Strategy:[/b]
[list]
[*]Diversify plort production across multiple slime types
[*]Sell balanced mixes daily to maintain stable prices
[*]Advanced: Hoard one plort type while selling others, then execute a massive sell-off during a price spike
[/list]

[h3]Largo Slimes: 4X Profit Multiplier[/h3]

Largos are the cornerstone of profitable ranching. When a slime eats a plort from a different species, it becomes a Largo that produces [b]BOTH plort types[/b] when fed.

[b]The Math:[/b]
[list]
[*]Base slime + normal food = 1 plort
[*]Base slime + favorite food = 2 plorts (same type)
[*]Largo + normal food = 2 plorts (one of each type)
[*][b]Largo + favorite food = 4 plorts total[/b] (two of each type)
[/list]

[b]Example:[/b]
[list]
[*]Pink Slime fed carrot: 1 Pink Plort (~10 Newbucks)
[*]Tabby-Pink Largo fed Stony Hen (Tabby favorite): 2 Tabby Plorts + 2 Pink Plorts (~50-80 Newbucks)
[/list]

[h3]‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Tarr Prevention[/h3]

[b]If a Largo eats a third plort type[/b], it transforms into a [b]Tarr[/b] - a hostile slime that devours other slimes on contact and replicates exponentially.

[b]Prevention (MANDATORY):[/b]
[list]
[*]Install [b]Plort Collectors[/b] on EVERY corral before leaving slimes unattended
[*]They automatically vacuum plorts off the ground before slimes can eat them
[*]A single missed plort can cascade into total ranch failure
[/list]

[b]Emergency Response:[/b]
[list]
[*]Water kills Tarr instantly (use Water Tank upgrade)
[*]Contain outbreaks immediately. Every second counts.
[/list]

[h3]The Agitation System[/h3]

All slimes have a hidden agitation value that affects behavior:
[list]
[*]Agitation begins at 99% hunger
[*]Takes ~12 in-game hours to reach maximum
[*]Agitated slimes exhibit negative behaviors (Rock slimes roll more, Boom slimes explode more, Hunter Largos go feral)
[/list]

[b]Solutions:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Feeding[/b] - The ONLY way to permanently reset agitation to zero
[*][b]Music Box[/b] (350 NB) - Halves agitation growth rate
[*][b]Slime Toys[/b] - Reduce agitation by 12.5% (favorite toys: 25%)
[*][b]Auto-Feeders[/b] - Best solution for long exploration trips
[/list]

[h3]Optimal Corral Population[/h3]

[b]The Magic Number: 5-6 Largos per corral[/b]

More slimes does NOT mean more profit. It means chaos, overcrowding, and reduced plort production.

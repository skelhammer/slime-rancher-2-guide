[h3]Phase 6: Core Mechanics Reference[/h3]

[b]Creating Largos:[/b]
[list]
[*]Feed a slime a different plort type to convert it
[*]Example: Tabby Slime + Cotton Plort = Tabby-Cotton Largo

[*][b]Plort Market:[/b] Sell plorts for Newbucks
[/list]

[b]Key Details:[/b]
[list]
[*]Optimal corral population: 6 Largos (8-10 regular slimes)
[*]Water Lettuce is Cotton favorite (4 plorts per feeding)
[/list]

[*][b]Night Hunt Phosphor:[/b] Collect 10 Phosphor Plorts at night
[*][b]Craft Resource Harvester:[/b] CRITICAL - required before harvesting Radiant Ore
[*][b]Harvest Radiant Ore:[/b] Collect 10 from Ember Valley
[*][b]Deploy Capital to Jetpack:[/b] Don't expand plots - save for Jetpack
[*][b]Corral Security:[/b] High Walls + Air Net prevent escapes

## Introduction: The Rancher's Mindset

Welcome, Rancher. You've just arrived on Rainbow Island with nothing but a Vacpack and a dream. This isn't your typical farming simulator where you tend a cozy homestead - this is a high-stakes resource management operation where every decision compounds into either exponential growth or stagnation.

This guide is built for ranchers who want to transform the wilds of Rainbow Island into a hyper-efficient, multi-million Newbuck profit engine.

### Three Core Principles

1. **Ruthless Asset Progression**: Your slimes are assets, not pets. Underperforming species must be liquidated to make way for those with higher profit yields. Market performance is the only metric that matters.

2. **Capital Must Be Deployed**: Newbucks are capital, not a score. Every coin must be immediately reinvested into infrastructure that provides a clear and rapid return on investment (ROI).

3. **Automate Everything**: Your time is the single most valuable resource on the ranch. The primary objective is to make your own labor obsolete through Auto-Feeders and Quantum Drones.

## Core Mechanics: Master These First

### The Plort Market: Supply & Demand

The plort market operates on dynamic supply and demand. Flooding the market with one plort type crashes its price the next day.

**Strategy:**
- Diversify plort production across multiple slime types
- Sell balanced mixes daily to maintain stable prices
- Advanced: Hoard one plort type while selling others, then execute a massive sell-off during a price spike

### Largo Slimes: 4X Profit Multiplier

Largos are the cornerstone of profitable ranching. When a slime eats a plort from a different species, it becomes a Largo that produces **BOTH plort types** when fed.

**The Math:**
- Base slime + normal food = 1 plort
- Base slime + favorite food = 2 plorts (same type)
- Largo + normal food = 2 plorts (one of each type)
- **Largo + favorite food = 4 plorts total** (two of each type)

**Example:**
- Pink Slime fed carrot: 1 Pink Plort (~10 Newbucks)
- Tabby-Pink Largo fed Stony Hen (Tabby favorite): 2 Tabby Plorts + 2 Pink Plorts (~50-80 Newbucks)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Tarr Prevention

**If a Largo eats a third plort type**, it transforms into a **Tarr** - a hostile slime that devours other slimes on contact and replicates exponentially.

**Prevention (MANDATORY):**
- Install **Plort Collectors** on EVERY corral before leaving slimes unattended
- They automatically vacuum plorts off the ground before slimes can eat them
- A single missed plort can cascade into total ranch failure

**Emergency Response:**
- Water kills Tarr instantly (use Water Tank upgrade)
- Contain outbreaks immediately. Every second counts.

### The Agitation System

All slimes have a hidden agitation value that affects behavior:
- Agitation begins at 99% hunger
- Takes ~12 in-game hours to reach maximum
- Agitated slimes exhibit negative behaviors (Rock slimes roll more, Boom slimes explode more, Hunter Largos go feral)

**Solutions:**
- **Feeding** - The ONLY way to permanently reset agitation to zero
- **Music Box** (350 NB) - Halves agitation growth rate
- **Slime Toys** - Reduce agitation by 12.5% (favorite toys: 25%)
- **Auto-Feeders** - Best solution for long exploration trips

### Optimal Corral Population

**The Magic Number: 5-6 Largos per corral**

More slimes does NOT mean more profit. It means chaos, overcrowding, and reduced plort production.

## Critical Tips

### Ranch Management
- **Never exceed 6 Largos per corral** - Overcrowding = agitation
- **Always use favorite foods** - 4 plorts vs 2 plorts per feeding
- **Stockpile Flutter Plorts early** - Need 300+ for Quantum Drones (Chapter 9)
- **Install Auto-Feeders before long trips** - Prevents agitation during exploration

### Resource Farming
- **Jellystone** - Rainbow Fields caves, craft early upgrades
- **Deep Brine** - Rainbow Fields pools/geysers, needed for all advanced upgrades
- **Radiant Ore** - Ember Valley glowing deposits
- **Buzz Wax & Wild Honey** - Starlight Strand, critical for Tier III upgrades
- **Sun Sap & Perfect Snowflakes** - Powderfall Bluffs, endgame materials

### Market Strategy
- **Diversify daily sales** - Sell 3-5 different plort types per day
- **Avoid market flooding** - Don't dump 100+ of one plort type
- **Watch for price spikes** - Some days offer 150-200% normal prices
- **Hoard high-value plorts** - Save Saber, Hyper, Shadow plorts for spike days

### Exploration
- **Pop Gordos strategically** - They unlock portals, paths, and treasure pods
- **Collect Map Data Nodes** - Reveals area layout and resource locations
- **Hunt Treasure Pods early** - Many contain blueprint upgrades
- **Ghostly Drones unlock automation** - Find 3 for Quantum Drone Stations

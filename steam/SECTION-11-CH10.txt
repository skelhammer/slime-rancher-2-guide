[hr][/hr]

[h3]Phase 1: Understanding Grey Labyrinth Mechanics[/h3]

[b]Critical Hazards:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Prisma Disruptions:[/b] Reality-altering energy waves that periodically sweep through zones
  - All loose food/plorts become "Unstable"
  - Dangerous plasma/flame energy erupts from ground cracks
[*][b]Unstable Items:[/b] Randomly JUMP out of your Vacpack unpredictably
  - Pop out if you take damage
  - Eventually vanish if left unstabilized
  - CANNOT use teleporters while carrying Unstable items
[*][b]Stabilization Methods:[/b]
  - Prisma Stabilizers (yellow portals - one-time use during disruptions)
  - Ancient Stabilizers (permanent archway structures - reusable)
[*][b]No Slime Sea:[/b] Bottom is cloud ocean - anything that falls is PERMANENTLY LOST
[*][b]Tarr Risk:[/b] Very common due to high slime variety and abundant food
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Phase 2: Gordo Strategy & Elite Slime Acquisition[/h3]

[b]Pop These 3 Gordos:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Twin Gordo[/b] (50 Fruit, Polaricherry counts 2x) → 12 Twin Slimes + Portal to Rainbow Fields
  - Location: Impossible Sky
[*][b]Sloomber Gordo[/b] (30 Meat, Candied Hen counts 2x) → 12 Sloomber Slimes + Portal to Conservatory
  - Location: Dream Land (North)
[*][b]Hyper Gordo[/b] (30 Veggies, Turbo Tater counts 2x) → 12 Hyper Slimes + Key switch
  - Location: Terrarium (requires Radiant Projector puzzle + 1 Hunter Plort + 1 Angler Plort)
[/list]

[b]Capture Strategy:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Twin Slimes:[/b] 10-12 from Impossible Sky (pop Gordo for 12 free)
[*][b]Sloomber Slimes:[/b] 10-12 from Dream Land (pop Gordo for 12 free)
[*][b]Hyper Slimes:[/b] 10-12 from Terrarium ONLY (pop Gordo for 12 free)
  - WARNING: Hyper Slimes are EXTREMELY bouncy and fast
[*]Collect 40-60 of each favorite food (Polaricherry, Candied Hen, Turbo Tater)
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Phase 3: New Slime Species[/h3]

[b]Grey Labyrinth Exclusive Slimes:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Shadow[/b] - Cannot be vacuumed or captured
  - Produces plorts when hit by ANY thrown object (item not consumed)
  - Jumps when disturbed, then vanishes
  - Farm for Shadow Plorts (needed for doors + Chapter 14)
[*][b]Twin[/b] (Fruit, favorite: Polaricherry) - Alternates blue/pink states, creates portals to snag distant food
[*][b]Sloomber[/b] (Meat, favorite: Candied Hen) - Emits sleep cloud that calms other slimes
[*][b]Hyper[/b] (Veggie, favorite: Turbo Tater) - Extremely fast, ricochets constantly, requires maximum security
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Phase 4: Shadow & Prisma Plort Farming (Introduction)[/h3]

[b]Shadow Plort Farming:[/b]
[list]
[*]Hit Shadow Slimes with thrown objects (Pink Plorts, vegetables, anything)
[*]They drop Shadow Plorts, then vanish
[*]Respawn in same dark corner locations
[*][b](Patch 1.1.0) Shadow Pots:[/b] Break open pots throughout Grey Labyrinth to release Shadow Slimes - can pick up and move pots for strategic farming!
[*]Total needed: 1,185 Shadow Plorts (1,165 for doors + 20 for Nullifier)
[*][b]CRITICAL:[/b] Store in SILOS, not Refinery (cannot use Refinery plorts for doors)
[/list]

[b]Prisma Plort Farming (Basic):[/b]
[list]
[*]During Prisma Disruptions, feed Unstable food to any slimes
[*]They produce Unstable Plorts
[*]Walk through Ancient Stabilizer → Unstable Plorts automatically convert to Prisma Plorts in inventory
[*]Conversion rate: 1 Unstable → 1-2 Prisma Plorts (typically 2)
[*]Total needed: ~245 Prisma Plorts (90 for Gigi trades + 155 for upgrades)
[*][b]CRITICAL:[/b] Store in SILOS, not Refinery (cannot trade Refinery plorts to Gigi)
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Phase 5: Warp Infrastructure[/h3]

[b]Deploy 6 Key Gadgets (Refinery Link + Market Link per zone):[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Impossible Sky:[/b] Refinery Link + Market Link near Twin Gordo area
[*][b]Dream Land:[/b] Refinery Link + Market Link in Dream Land North
[*][b]Terrarium:[/b] Refinery Link + Market Link in central Terrarium
[/list]

[b]Total Investment:[/b] 1,500 NB + materials

[b]Benefits:[/b] Deposit crafting materials immediately, sell plorts without returning to ranch, prevents loss from falls/Tarr

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Strategic Priorities[/h3]

[olist]
[*][b]Map First:[/b] Activate all 7 Grey Labyrinth Map Data Nodes before deep exploration
[*][b]Pop Gordos for Portals:[/b] Twin (Rainbow Fields), Sloomber (Conservatory), Hyper (key switch)
[*][b]Capture Breeding Stock:[/b] 10-12 of each elite slime type (Twin, Sloomber, Hyper)
[*][b]Collect Favorite Foods:[/b] 40-60 of each (Polaricherry, Candied Hen, Turbo Tater)
[*][b]Farm Shadow Plorts Opportunistically:[/b] Start collecting for Chapter 13 (1,165 total needed)
[*][b]Store Plorts in Silos:[/b] NEVER put Shadow/Prisma Plorts in Refinery until door/milestone objectives complete
[*][b]Do Not Ranch Here:[/b] Grey Labyrinth is extraction zone, not ranching expansion
[/olist]

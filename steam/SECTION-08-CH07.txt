[h3]Phase 2: Saber Gordo & Asset Acquisition[/h3]

[b]Saber Gordo:[/b]
[list]
[*]Location: Northern area, high mountain plateau

[list]
[*]10-12 Saber Slimes (pop Saber Gordo for 12 free)

[/list]

[h3]Phase 3: Critical Resource Extraction[/h3]

[b]Priority Resources:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Sun Sap[/b] (ULTRA-RARE) - From frozen trees (golden sap)
  - CRITICAL bottleneck for endgame upgrades
  - MARK ALL TREE LOCATIONS for weekly farming (5-7 day respawns)
  - Target: 5-10 Sun Sap stockpiled
[*][b]Perfect Snowflakes[/b] - Cliff faces (glimmering) - Target: 50+
[*][b]Slime Fossils[/b] - Cave walls - Target: 30+
[/list]

[b]Priority Treasure Pod:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Sun Sap x3[/b] - Top of cliff in forested area (Jetpack required)
  - Provides 30% of total endgame requirements
  - Collect immediately
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Phase 4: Upgrades & Warp Infrastructure[/h3]

[b]Craft This Upgrade:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Extra Tank II[/b] (3,000 NB + materials) - Adds 5th vac slot
  - RECOMMENDED for Powderfall resource runs
[/list]

[b]Deploy Warp System:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Refinery Link[/b] (250 NB) - Central valley plateau near Map Data Node
[*][b]Powderfall Portal[/b] (2,000 NB) - One-way to Powderfall (place in Conservatory)
[*][b]Blue Home Portal[/b] (500 NB) - One-way to Conservatory (place in central valley)
[/list]

[b]Strategic Rationale:[/b] Sun Sap is rarest crafting material with very slow respawns (5-7 days). Portal enables efficient weekly farming runs to check all marked tree locations.

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Strategic Priorities[/h3]

[olist]
[*][b]Map First:[/b] Activate Northern Mountain Summit Map Data Node immediately
[*][b]Pop Saber Gordo:[/b] Unlock portal shortcut, receive 12 free Saber Slimes
[*][b]Mark Sun Sap Trees:[/b] CRITICAL - every tree location must be marked for future weekly farming
[*][b]Collect Thunderclucks:[/b] 20-30 Thunderclucks (including Roostros) for breeding program
[*][b]Priority Treasure Pods:[/b] Sun Sap x3 treasure pod (30% of endgame requirements), Powderfall Portal
[*][b]Deploy Warp Infrastructure:[/b] Portal system for efficient resource farming returns
[*][b]Craft Extra Tank II:[/b] 5th vac slot essential for extended resource runs
[/olist]

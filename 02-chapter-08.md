## Chapter 8: The Den - Ranch Reorganization

**Mindset:** _Reorganize for maximum efficiency._

Unlock The Den and execute a ranch-wide reorganization to consolidate nocturnal operations and optimize food distribution.

### The Operational Blueprint

**Primary Objective:** Unlock The Den and consolidate all fruit-eating nocturnal slimes into one expansion

**Financial Checkpoint:**
- **Starting Budget:** Should have 40,000-50,000+ Newbucks from Chapter 7 operations
- **Required:** ~17,180 Newbucks for Den unlock (2,800 NB), build-out (13,905 NB), and Conservatory adjustments (475 NB)
- **Daily Revenue:** ~6,500-8,000 Newbucks from all operations
- **Timeline:** Achieve in 2-3 days through all operations
- **Farming Strategy:** If short on funds, spend 2-3 days farming plorts while simultaneously capturing slimes needed for reorganization (6 Flutter, 6 Batty, 6 Ringtail slimes from Starlight Strand and Ember Valley) and collecting plorts (Ringtail, Honey, Phosphor) for Largo creation

**Strategic Priorities:**

- Unlock The Den expansion (2,800 Newbucks - accessed via Conservatory)
- Relocate Boom-Batty Largos from Conservatory to The Den (eliminates Solar Shield cost)
- Establish two new nocturnal operations (Flutter-Phosphor and Batty-Ringtail Largos)
- Rebuild Conservatory Plots 1 and 7 with new largos (Flutter-Crystal, Cotton-Ringtail)
- Reorganize The Gully for pure carnivore operations (Saber-Hunter, Angler-Crystal)

**Key Success Metrics:**

- The Den unlocked and fully developed (5 plots)
- Three nocturnal largos moved to The Den (saves 1,275 NB in Solar Shield costs)
- Conservatory reorganized: 3 veggie corrals + 1 fruit corral
- The Gully reorganized: 2 meat corrals with specialty chicken coops
- Total ranch revenue increased to 6,500-8,500+ Newbucks/day
- Double Flutter Plort production: 24-36 plorts/day from 2 operations

**Capital Requirements:**

- Den Unlock: 2,800 Newbucks
- Den Build-Out: ~13,905 Newbucks (3 corrals + 2 gardens)
- Conservatory Rebuild: ~475 Newbucks (1 Solar Shield + 1 garden replanting)
- Recommended Starting Budget: 15,000+ Newbucks

#### Phase 1: Unlock The Den

**Capital Required:** 2,800 Newbucks

The Den is accessed from the western side of the Conservatory. This 5-plot expansion will become your ranch's nocturnal operations center.

**Location:** Western side of Conservatory (look for the cave entrance with wooden supports)

**Layout:** Sheltered grotto area carved into the hillside. Naturally dark 24/7, which means **nocturnal slimes do not require Solar Shields here**.

**CRITICAL:** The Den's permanent darkness eliminates the need for Solar Shields on Batty and Phosphor slimes, saving 425 Newbucks per corral (1,275 NB total across 3 corrals). This makes it the perfect location for all nocturnal operations.

#### Phase 2: Asset Acquisition & Preparation

Before beginning construction, gather all necessary slimes and resources.

**Slimes and Plorts Needed:**

- **For Flutter-Phosphor Largos (Den):** 6 Flutter Slimes + 6 Phosphor Plorts (from wild Phosphor Slimes at night)
- **For Batty-Ringtail Largos (Den):** 6 Batty Slimes + 6 Ringtail Plorts (from wild Ringtail Slimes - spawn at night in multiple biomes)
- **For Flutter-Honey Largos (Conservatory):** 6 Flutter Slimes + 6 Honey Plorts (from wild Honey Slimes in Starlight Strand)
- **For Saber-Hunter Largos (Gully):** Should already have Saber Slimes from Chapter 7, need 6 Hunter Plorts (from wild Hunter Slimes in Starlight Strand or reserves from Chapter 4)

**Food Stockpile:**

- 30+ Pomegranites (Batty favorite - Ember Valley or Starlight Strand)
- 30+ Cuberries (Phosphor favorite - Starlight Strand)
- 30+ Mint Mangos (Honey favorite - Starlight Strand)

#### Phase 3: Plot-by-Plot Build

Execute the following build in order:

**The Den (5 plots - NEW EXPANSION):**

| **Plot** | **Type** | **Contents** | **Base Cost** | **Upgrades** | **Total Cost** | **Purpose/Notes** |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **1** | Corral | Boom-Batty Largos (6) | 250 NB | High Walls (260), Air Net (425), Plort Collector (750), Auto-Feeder (750), Music Box (350) | 2,785 NB | **RELOCATED** from Conservatory Plot 7. Feed Pomegranites (Batty favorite, 4 plorts/feeding) |
| **2** | Corral | Flutter-Phosphor Largos (6) | 250 NB | High Walls (260), Air Net (425), Plort Collector (750), Auto-Feeder (750) | 2,435 NB | **NEW** - Produces Flutter + Phosphor Plorts. Feed Cuberries (Phosphor favorite, 4 plorts/feeding). **DO NOT SELL Flutter Plorts** (need for Ch 9 Quantum Drones) |
| **3** | Corral | Batty-Ringtail Largos (6) | 250 NB | High Walls (260), Air Net (425), Plort Collector (750), Auto-Feeder (750), Music Box (350) | 2,785 NB | **NEW** - Produces Batty + Ringtail Plorts. Feed Pomegranites (Batty favorite) OR Cuberries (Ringtail omnivore). Ringtail turns to stone in sunlight - The Den is dark (perfect habitat) |
| **4** | Garden | Pomegranites | 250 NB | Nutrient Soil (600), Sprinkler (700) | 1,550 NB | Feeds Plots 1 & 3 (Batty favorite) |
| **5** | Garden | Cuberries | 250 NB | Nutrient Soil (600), Sprinkler (700) | 1,550 NB | Feeds Plot 2 (Phosphor favorite) |

**Total Investment:** 2,800 NB (expansion) + 11,105 NB (plots/upgrades) = 13,905 NB

#### Phase 4: Ranch Reorganization

This chapter involves reorganizing existing ranch operations across multiple expansions to optimize efficiency.

**Conservatory Reorganization:**

**RELOCATION:**

1. **Plot 7-8:** Relocate Boom-Batty Largos to The Den Plot 1

**Plot 1-2: Tabby-Cotton Largos + Water Lettuce - UNCHANGED**

- Established in Chapter 2, no changes needed
- Continues producing Tabby + Cotton plorts for upgrade series

**Plot 3-4: Phosphor-Honey Largos + Cuberries - UNCHANGED**

- Established in Chapter 2, has Solar Shield
- Continues producing Phosphor + Honey plorts

**Plot 5-6: Crystal-Rock Largos + Heart Beets - UNCHANGED**

- Established in Chapter 3, no changes needed
- Continues producing Crystal + Rock plorts

**Plot 7 (Corral): Flutter-Honey Largos (NEW - replaces Boom-Batty)**

- **Build Order:** Deploy 6 Flutter Slimes, feed 6 Honey Plorts to create Flutter-Honey Largos
- **Investment:** 0 Newbucks (reuses existing corral with Solar Shield from Batty)
- **Feed Strategy:** Mint Mangos from Plot 8 (Honey favorite)
- **Note:** Solar Shield already installed from Boom-Batty, works for Flutter component
- **CRITICAL:** DO NOT SELL Flutter Plorts (needed for Chapter 9 Quantum Drones)

**Plot 8 (Garden): Mint Mango Production (replant from Pomegranites)**

- **Investment:** 50 Newbucks (Mint Mango seeds)

**The Gully Reorganization:**

**LIQUIDATION:**

1. **Plot 5:** Liquidate Flutter-Tabby Largos (release into Slime Sea)

**Plot 1 (Coop): Thundercluck Breeding Facility (replace Stony Hens)**

- **Investment:** 0 Newbucks (replace 6-8 Stony Hens with 6-8 Thunderclucks captured in Chapter 7 from Powderfall Bluffs wild coops + 2 Roostros)

**Plots 2-4: Sea Hen Coop, Food Silo, Angler-Crystal Largos - UNCHANGED**

**Plot 5 (Corral): Saber-Hunter Largos (NEW - replaces Flutter-Tabby)**

- **Investment:** 0 Newbucks (reusing corral, remove Solar Shield if desired)
- **Feed Strategy:** Thunderclucks from Plot 1 (Saber favorite)
- **Note:** Solar Shield not needed for Saber-Hunter (can be removed and reused elsewhere)

#### Phase 5: Key Notes

**Auto-Feeder Setup:**
- Den Plot 1 (Boom-Batty): Pomegranites | Plot 2 (Flutter-Phosphor): Cuberries | Plot 3 (Batty-Ringtail): Pomegranites
- Conservatory Plot 7 (Flutter-Honey): Mint Mangos
- Gully Plot 5 (Saber-Hunter): Thunderclucks

**CRITICAL - Flutter Plorts:**
- Two operations produce 24-36 Flutter Plorts/day (Flutter-Honey + Flutter-Phosphor)
- **DO NOT SELL** - Deposit all into Refinery
- Target: 300+ for Chapter 9 Quantum Drones

#### Phase 6: Infrastructure Gadgets (Optional Quality-of-Life)

**Market Link:**
- Central area near Plots 1-3 (corrals)
- 250 NB + 20 Pink Plorts + 10 Buzz Wax + 10 Primordy Oil + 5 Silky Sand

**Refinery Link:**
- Near entrance from The Conservatory
- 250 NB + 10 Phosphor Plorts + 10 Jellystone + 5 Deep Brine

**Dash Pad:**
- Path between Conservatory entrance and The Den entrance
- 500 NB + 10 Crystal Plorts + 10 Angler Plorts + 5 Lava Dust + 5 Silky Sand

#### Additional Reorganization Tips

- **Flutter Plorts:** Two operations produce 24-36 plorts/day (Flutter-Honey in Conservatory, Flutter-Phosphor in Den). Target: 300+ for Chapter 9 Quantum Drones. DO NOT SELL - deposit into Refinery
- **Food Organization:** Fruit (Den + 1 Conservatory corral), Veggie (3 Conservatory corrals), Meat (2 Gully corrals)
- **Chicken Coops:** Maintain 2 Roostros per 6-8 hens. Check Elder Collector every 1-2 days
- **Solar Shields:** Conservatory has 2 Solar Shields (Phosphor-Honey Plot 3, Flutter-Honey Plot 7). The Den requires none due to permanent darkness.
- **Occasional Spawns:** Jellystone occasionally spawns in The Den, providing a convenient backup crafting resource.

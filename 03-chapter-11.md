## Chapter 11: The Archway - Grey Labyrinth Operations

**Mindset:** _Elite asset integration._

You've captured Rainbow Island's most valuable slimes from the Grey Labyrinth. Now it's time to integrate them into your automated empire and establish the highest-value plort production on your ranch.

### The Operational Blueprint

#### Phase 1: Unlock The Archway

**Capital Required:** 2,800 Newbucks

The Archway is accessed from the northwest corner of the Conservatory. This 5-plot expansion will become your Grey Labyrinth operations center.

**Location:** Northwest corner of the Conservatory (look for the stone archway near the northern cliffs)

#### Phase 2: Plot-by-Plot Build

Execute the following build in order:

**Plot 1: Garden - Polaricherry**
- **Cost:** 250 Newbucks
- **Purpose:** Feeds Twin-Flutter Largos (Plot 2)
- **Upgrade:** Install Nutrient Soil (600 Newbucks) + Sprinkler (700 Newbucks)
- **Deposit:** Polaricherry (collected from Grey Labyrinth)
- **Yield:** 20 Polaricherries per harvest (enhanced yield)

**Plot 2: Corral - Twin-Flutter Largos**
- **Cost:** 250 Newbucks (corral)
- **Slimes:** 6 Twin-Flutter Largos
- **Creation:** Feed 6 Twin Slimes with Flutter Plorts (or vice versa)
- **Upgrades:**
  - High Walls: 260 Newbucks (mandatory - Twin slimes jump)
  - Auto-Feeder: 750 Newbucks (set to Normal speed, stock with Polaricherry)
  - Plort Collector: 750 Newbucks (collects Twin + Flutter plorts)
- **Diet:** Fruit (Polaricherry from Plot 1)
- **Plort Production:** Twin Plorts (23-84) + Flutter Plorts (30-50)
- **Special:** Flutter's calming aura reduces agitation, Twin creates portals to grab distant food
- **Revenue per Feeding:** ~100-150 Newbucks (4 plorts total with favorite food)

**Plot 3: Coop - Candied Hens + Roostros**
- **Cost:** 250 Newbucks
- **Purpose:** Breeds Candied Hens for Sloomber-Saber Largos (Plot 4)
- **Upgrades:**
  - High Walls: 200 Newbucks
  - Spring Grass: 600 Newbucks (speeds chick growth)
  - Vitamizer: 700 Newbucks (increases egg production)
- **Stock:** 6-8 Candied Hens + 2 Roostros (collected from Grey Labyrinth - Dream Land)
- **Production:** Candied Hens breed continuously

**Plot 4: Corral - Sloomber-Saber Largos**
- **Cost:** 250 Newbucks (corral)
- **Slimes:** 6 Sloomber-Saber Largos
- **Creation:** Feed 6 Sloomber Slimes with Saber Plorts (or vice versa)
- **Upgrades:**
  - High Walls: 260 Newbucks (mandatory - Saber slimes are aggressive)
  - Music Box: 350 Newbucks (CRITICAL - reduces Saber aggression, Sloomber sleep clouds help)
  - Auto-Feeder: 750 Newbucks (set to Normal speed, stock with Candied Hens)
  - Plort Collector: 750 Newbucks (collects Sloomber + Saber plorts)
- **Diet:** Meat (Candied Hen from Plot 3 - Sloomber favorite)
- **Plort Production:** Sloomber Plorts (37-85) + Saber Plorts (42-70)
- **Special:** Sloomber's sleep clouds pacify aggressive Saber component - synergistic combination
- **Revenue per Feeding:** ~150-250 Newbucks (4 plorts total with favorite food)
- **HIGHEST VALUE COMBO IN THE GAME**

**Plot 5: Silo - Plort & Food Storage**
- **Cost:** 450 Newbucks
- **Purpose:** Local storage for Grey Labyrinth plorts and food
- **Upgrades:**
  - Tier 1 Storage: 500 Newbucks (6 slots, 600 capacity)
  - Tier 2 Storage: 575 Newbucks (9 slots, 900 capacity)
  - Tier 3 Storage: 650 Newbucks (12 slots, 1,200 capacity)
- **Storage Strategy:**
  - Store Twin, Sloomber, Saber, Flutter plorts here
  - Keep buffer stock of Polaricherry and Candied Hens
  - DO NOT put Grey Labyrinth plorts in Refinery yet (needed for Chapter 13-14)

#### Phase 3: Automation Integration

**Auto-Feeder Setup:**
- Plot 2 (Twin-Flutter): Stock with Polaricherry, set to Normal speed
- Plot 4 (Sloomber-Saber): Stock with Candied Hens, set to Normal speed

**Plort Collector Management:**
- Both corrals have Plort Collectors that auto-vacuum plorts
- Plorts stored in corral's built-in plort storage (2 types max)
- Manually collect and deposit to Silo (Plot 5) when full
- **OR** set up Quantum Drone to transport plorts from corrals to Silo

**Food Restocking:**
- Plot 1 (Polaricherry Garden): Harvest every 2-3 in-game days, restock Plot 2 Auto-Feeder
- Plot 3 (Candied Hen Coop): Collect hens as needed, restock Plot 4 Auto-Feeder
- **OR** set up Quantum Drones to automate food restocking

#### Phase 4: Teleporter Network (Optional Quality-of-Life)

**Purpose:** Establish two-way teleporter connections between ranch areas and Grey Labyrinth for fast travel.

**Why Teleporters?**
- **Two-way travel:** Unlike Refinery Links (one-way), Teleporters allow instant round-trip transport
- **Grey Labyrinth access:** Dramatically speeds up Shadow/Prisma Plort farming runs
- **Ranch navigation:** Quick travel between distant expansions
- **Keep Refinery Links:** Teleporters augment (not replace) your existing one-way Refinery Links

**Recommended Teleporter Network (10 teleporter sets total):**

**Tier 1 - Essential Grey Labyrinth Access:**

**1. Gold Teleporter - Conservatory ↔ Grey Labyrinth Waterworks**
- **Cost:** 1,200 NB + 30 Twin Plorts + 20 Tin Petal + 20 Radiant Ore + 10 Wild Honey + 2 Royal Jelly
- **Placement:** Conservatory (near Lab) ↔ Waterworks central hub (near Stabilizing Gate)
- **Priority:** HIGHEST - Your main Grey Labyrinth farming access

**2. Blue Teleporter - Grey Labyrinth Internal (Waterworks ↔ Dream Land)**
- **Cost:** 2,000 NB + 30 Rock Plorts + 10 Deep Brine + 10 Radiant Ore + 5 Wild Honey + 2 Strange Diamonds

- **Placement:** Conservatory central ↔ The Gully central
- **Why:** Connect main hub to western carnivore operations

**4. Pink Teleporter - Conservatory ↔ The Tidepools**
- **Cost:** 1,200 NB + 30 Pink Plorts + 10 Jellystone + 10 Radiant Ore + 5 Lava Dust + 2 Strange Diamonds
- **Placement:** Conservatory central ↔ The Tidepools central
- **Why:** Quick access to passive income area

**5. Snowy Teleporter - Conservatory ↔ The Den**
- **Cost:** 1,200 NB + 30 Ringtail Plorts + 20 Slime Fossil + 20 Radiant Ore + 10 Lava Dust + 2 Strange Diamonds
- **Placement:** Conservatory central ↔ The Den central
- **Why:** Fast travel to nocturnal operations (you have Ringtail Plorts from Ch 8)

**6. Grey Teleporter - Conservatory ↔ The Archway**
- **Cost:** 2,000 NB + 30 Tabby Plorts + 15 Buzz Wax + 15 Radiant Ore + 10 Silky Sand + 2 Strange Diamonds
- **Placement:** Conservatory central ↔ The Archway central
- **Why:** Quick access to your new Grey Labyrinth slime operations

**Tier 3 - Advanced Connections (Optional):**

**7. Green Teleporter - The Gully ↔ The Tidepools**
- **Cost:** 3,000 NB + 30 Twin Plorts + 20 Tin Petal + 10 Black Indigonium + 10 Dream Bubble + 2 Royal Jelly
- **Placement:** The Gully ↔ The Tidepools
- **Why:** Connect western and southern expansions (saves travel through Conservatory)

- **Cost:** 3,000 NB + 30 Hyper Plorts + 20 Tin Petal + 10 Aqua Glass + 10 Magma Comb + 2 Royal Jelly
- **Placement:** The Den ↔ The Archway
- **Why:** Connect eastern expansions (requires Hyper Plorts from Ch 12 or wild farming)

**9. Amber Teleporter - The Digsite ↔ Grey Labyrinth (if Chapter 12 built)**
- **Cost:** 4,000 NB + 30 Dervish Plorts + 20 Tin Petal + 10 Dream Bubble + 10 Aqua Glass + 2 Royal Jelly
- **Placement:** The Digsite ↔ Grey Labyrinth Terrarium
- **Why:** Direct access from weather slime operations to Hyper slime zone (ONLY if you built Ch 12)

**10. Berry Teleporter - Grey Labyrinth Internal (Impossible Sky ↔ Lava Depths)**
- **Cost:** 4,000 NB + 30 Sloomber Plorts + 20 Tin Petal + 10 Black Indigonium + 10 Magma Comb + 2 Royal Jelly

- **Tier 2 (Ranch Network):** 8,000 NB - Connect all ranch expansions to Conservatory hub
- **Tier 3 (Advanced):** 14,000 NB - Cross-connections and complete coverage
- **Grand Total:** 25,200 Newbucks + materials (if building all 10)

**When to Craft:**
- Craft after establishing Archway operations (you'll have Twin Plorts)
- Grey Labyrinth resources available from Chapter 10 exploration
- Wait until you have 15,000+ NB surplus (don't delay Chapter 12-13 progress)

**Important Notes:**
- Each teleporter set creates TWO devices (you place both ends)
- Teleporters require line-of-sight between devices to function
- Cannot use teleporters while carrying Unstable items during Prisma Disruptions
- Different colored teleporters are independent networks (Gold teleporter only connects to other Gold teleporter)

### Strategic Priorities

1. **Install All Auto-Feeders FIRST**: This is non-negotiable. Grey Labyrinth slimes are too valuable to risk starvation.
2. **Music Box on Sloomber-Saber Corral**: The Saber component is aggressive. The Music Box + Sloomber sleep clouds keep them calm.
3. **Continue Grey Labyrinth Farming**: During ranch downtime, return to Grey Labyrinth to farm Shadow/Prisma Plorts for Chapter 13-14.
4. **Monitor Plort Prices**: Diversify sales - don't flood market with one plort type.

### Financial Checkpoint

**Total Capital Required:**
- Expansion: 2,800 Newbucks
- Plots: 1,450 Newbucks (5 plots: 250 + 250 + 250 + 250 + 450)
- Upgrades: ~8,400 Newbucks (gardens, corrals, coop, silo upgrades)
- **Total: ~12,650 Newbucks**

**Revenue Added:**
- Twin-Flutter Largos: ~100-150 Newbucks per feeding × 6 slimes = 600-900/day
- Sloomber-Saber Largos: ~150-250 Newbucks per feeding × 6 slimes = 900-1,500/day
- **Total Archway Revenue: +2,000-3,500 Newbucks/day**

**Total Ranch Revenue (after Chapter 11):**
- Previous Ranch Revenue (Ch 9): ~6,500-8,500 Newbucks/day
- Archway Addition: +2,000-3,500 Newbucks/day
- **New Total: ~8,500-12,000+ Newbucks/day**

### Success Metrics

By the end of Chapter 11, you should have:
- ✅ The Archway expansion unlocked and operational
- ✅ Twin-Flutter Largos established in Plot 2
- ✅ Sloomber-Saber Largos established in Plot 4
- ✅ Auto-Feeders installed and stocked on both corrals
- ✅ Candied Hen breeding operation in Plot 3
- ✅ Polaricherry garden producing in Plot 1
- ✅ Silo storage for Grey Labyrinth plorts
- ✅ Grey Labyrinth elite slimes fully integrated into ranch automation

### Next Chapter Preparation

The Digsite expansion is OPTIONAL. If you've collected Dervish and Tangle slimes from weather events, Chapter 12 provides a home for them. If you haven't collected weather slimes or don't care about them, **skip Chapter 12 entirely** and proceed to Chapter 13 (The Endgame Audit).

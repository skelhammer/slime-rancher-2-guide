## Chapter 11: The Digsite - Tabby Operations

**Mindset:** _Complete the slime collection._

Establish additional Tabby-based Largo operations and complete your pre-Labyrinth slime collection.

### The Operational Blueprint

**Primary Objective:** Establish Tabby-based Largo operations and complete pre-Labyrinth slime collection

**Financial Checkpoint:**
- **Starting Budget:** Should have 100,000-150,000+ Newbucks from Chapter 10 automated operations
- **Required:** ~30,000 Newbucks for Digsite unlock (6,000 NB), build-out (9,960 NB), and optional 5th Quantum Drone (100,000 NB if purchasing vs hunting)
- **Daily Revenue:** ~12,000-17,000 Newbucks from all automated operations
- **Timeline:** Achieve in 1-2 days through fully automated ranch
- **Farming Strategy:** With full automation, ranch generates massive passive income. Focus exploration time on capturing Tabby slimes from Rainbow Fields for new operations

**Strategic Priorities:**

- Unlock The Digsite expansion (6,000 Newbucks - accessed via The Den)
- Capture Tabby Slimes from Rainbow Fields
- Build Tabby-Saber Largo operation (elite carnivore division)
- Build Tabby-Boom Largo operation (secondary carnivore division)
- Establish Stony Hen breeding facility (shared protein supply)
- Deploy strategic silo for plort storage and Quantum Drone automation

**Key Success Metrics:**

- The Digsite unlocked with 4 plots developed
- Tabby-Saber Largos operational (high-value carnivore plorts)
- Tabby-Boom Largos operational (secondary carnivore division)
- Stony Hen breeding facility producing meat supply
- Quantum Drone fully automating The Digsite operations
- Daily revenue from Digsite: 1,500-2,500+ Newbucks

**Capital Requirements:**

- Digsite Unlock: 6,000 Newbucks (via The Den)
- Full Build-Out: ~9,960 Newbucks (2 corrals, 1 coop, 1 silo with upgrades)
- Quantum Drone Station: 5,000 Newbucks + 100 Flutter Plorts + materials
- Recommended Starting Budget: 25,000+ Newbucks total

**Strategic Value:**

- Completes Tabby slime integration (final common slime species)
- Tabby plorts (~15-30 NB) + Saber plorts (~42-70 NB) = ~57-100 NB per feeding
- Tabby plorts (~15-30 NB) + Boom plorts (~30-50 NB) = ~45-80 NB per feeding
- Combined daily output: 1,500-2,500+ Newbucks from this expansion

### Accessing The Digsite

Before you can begin development, you must unlock this expansion.

- **Location:** The entrance to The Digsite is located at the far end of The Den, marked by an excavation tunnel with mining equipment
- **Unlock Cost:** 6,000 Newbucks
- **Layout:** The Digsite is an underground excavation area with exposed rock walls. 4 plots arranged in a quarry-like formation with mining lanterns

**Access Requirements:**

- Must have unlocked The Den first (Chapter 8)
- Navigate through The Den to the western tunnels
- Look for mining equipment and excavation markers

### Phase 1: Asset Acquisition

Before building, capture the slimes you need.

**For Tabby-Saber Largos:**

- **6 Tabby Slimes:** Rainbow Fields - fast, agile, easy to catch
- **6 Saber Plorts:** Should have reserves from Chapter 7/8 Saber operations

**For Tabby-Boom Largos:**

- **6 Tabby Slimes:** Rainbow Fields - same location as above
- **6 Boom Plorts:** From wild Boom Slimes in Ember Valley or your reserves

**Additional Resources:**

- 20-30 Stony Hens (Ember Valley - for Tabby's favorite food)

### Ranch Development & Plot Allocation: The Digsite Build-Out (4 plots)

#### Phase 1: Elite Carnivore Division - Tabby-Saber Largos

**Plot 1 (Corral): Tabby-Saber Largo Division (6 largos)**

- **Build Order:** Corral (250) → High Walls (260) → Air Net (425) → Plort Collector (750) → Auto-Feeder (750) → Music Box (350)
- **Total Investment:** 2,785 Newbucks
- **Creation:** Deploy 6 Tabby Slimes, feed 6 Saber Plorts to create Tabby-Saber Largos
- **Feed Strategy:** Stony Hens from Plot 2 (Tabby's favorite food)

#### Phase 2: Omnivore Division - Tabby-Boom Largos

**Plot 3 (Corral): Tabby-Boom Largo Division (6 largos)**

- **Build Order:** Corral (250) → High Walls (260) → Air Net (425) → Plort Collector (750) → Auto-Feeder (750) → Music Box (350)
- **Total Investment:** 2,785 Newbucks
- **Creation:** Deploy 6 Tabby Slimes, feed 6 Boom Plorts to create Tabby-Boom Largos
- **Feed Strategy:** Stony Hens from Plot 2 (Tabby favorite food)

#### Phase 3: Protein Production

**Plot 2 (Coop): Stony Hen Breeding Facility**

- **Build Order:** Coop (250) → High Walls (200) → Spring Grass (425) → Vitamizer (500) → Elder Collector (1,300)
- **Total Investment:** 2,675 Newbucks
- **Deployment:** 8-10 Stony Hens + 2 Roostros
- **Purpose:** Dedicated Stony Hen supply for Tabby's favorite food bonus (feeds both Plot 1 and Plot 3)
- **Production:** Sustainable specialty chicken production with minimal intervention
- **Collection:** Elder Collector automates harvesting at end of lifespan

#### Phase 4: Support Infrastructure

**Plot 4 (Silo): Resource Quarry Depot**

- **Build Order:** Silo (450) → Storage Tier 1 (500) → Storage Tier 2 (575) → Storage Tier 3 (650)
- **Total Investment:** 2,175 Newbucks

**Storage Allocation:**

- Slots 1-4: High-Value Plorts (Tabby, Saber, Boom) for price monitoring
- Slots 5-12: Food Reserves (Stony Hens, Roostros for other operations)

**Purpose:** Plort storage for price monitoring and food distribution across ranch

**Note:** All resources and crafting materials should be stored in the Refinery (999 capacity per item), NOT in silos

### Phase 2: The Digsite Resources

The Digsite does not contain any high-density resource nodes. Focus on ranching operations rather than resource extraction.

### Quantum Drone Automation for The Digsite

**Drone 5 - Digsite Plort Collection (Recommended)**

If you have a 5th Quantum Drone (purchased from ProntoMart for 100,000 NB or found in exploration zones), The Digsite benefits from automation:

**Station Location:** The Digsite - central area

**Programming:**
- **Target:** Plorts
- **Source:** Plort Collector
- **Destination:** Silo (for price monitoring and storage)

**Result:** Continuously collects ALL plorts from Tabby-Saber and Tabby-Boom corrals and stores them

**Expected Result:** All plorts automatically collected and stored

**Note:** You'll need to manually feed the corrals for favorite food bonuses. However, both corrals share the SAME favorite food (Stony Hens), so food automation DOES work well here.

**Optional - Food Automation (ACCEPTABLE HERE):** Since both corrals eat the SAME favorite food, you CAN automate:
- **Target:** Stony Hens (specific food type)
- **Source:** Coop
- **Destination:** Auto-Feeder
- **Result:** Distributes Stony Hens to ALL auto-feeders (both Tabby-Saber and Tabby-Boom corrals)
- **Why This Works:** Both largos have Tabby as a component, so Stony Hens are the favorite food for BOTH - you don't lose the 4-plort bonus!

**Battery Management:** Charge with Tabby Plorts (cheap and abundant) - 20-30 plorts keeps drone running for weeks

### Additional Digsite Management Tips

**Tabby-Saber Largo Management:**

- Tabby component makes these Largos extremely fast and agile
- Saber component adds aggression to the mix
- Music Box is MANDATORY for both components
- Stony Hen feeding: 4 plorts per feeding (2 Tabby + 2 Saber with favorite food bonus)
- High Walls + Air Net + Music Box = absolutely required for containment

**Tabby-Boom Largo Management:**

- Tabby speed + Boom explosiveness = active corral
- Music Box helps calm Boom's explosive behavior
- Feed Strategy: Stony Hens (Tabby favorite food = 4 plorts per feeding)
- Share Stony Hen supply with Plot 1 Tabby-Saber Largos

**Stony Hen Breeding Optimization:**

- Maintain 2 Roostros per 8-10 Hens
- Elder Collector automatically harvests at end of lifespan
- Check collector every 1-2 days if not using Quantum Drone
- Stony Hens feed both Plot 1 (Tabby-Saber) and Plot 3 (Tabby-Boom) with favorite food bonus

**Additional Digsite Tips:**

- **Occasional Spawns:** Jellystone occasionally spawns in The Digsite, providing a convenient backup crafting resource.
- **Refinery Link:** Deploy a Refinery Link in The Digsite for easy plort deposits while exploring.

### Optional: Dash Pad Connection

**Cost:** 500 Newbucks + 10 Crystal Plorts + 10 Angler Plorts + 5 Lava Dust + 5 Silky Sand

**Placement:** Position 1 Dash Pad along the path between The Den entrance and The Digsite entrance (accessed via The Den)

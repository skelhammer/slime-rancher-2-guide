## Chapter 11: The Archway - Grey Labyrinth Operations

**Mindset:** _Elite asset integration._

You've captured Rainbow Island's most valuable slimes from the Grey Labyrinth. Now it's time to integrate them into your automated empire and establish the highest-value plort production on your ranch.

### The Operational Blueprint

**Primary Objective:** Integrate Grey Labyrinth slimes into automated ranch operations and establish highest-value plort production

**Financial Checkpoint:**
- **Starting Budget:** Should have 50,000-70,000+ Newbucks from Chapter 10 operations
- **Required:** ~12,650 Newbucks for Archway unlock (2,800 NB) and build-out (9,845 NB)
- **Daily Revenue:** ~6,500-8,500 Newbucks from all operations
- **Timeline:** Achieve in 2-3 days through all operations
- **Farming Strategy:** If short on funds, spend 2-3 days farming plorts while simultaneously collecting Grey Labyrinth resources (Polaricherry, Candied Hens, Twin Plorts, Sloomber Plorts) from Chapter 10 exploration

**Strategic Priorities:**

- Unlock The Archway expansion (2,800 Newbucks - accessed from northwest corner of Conservatory)
- Establish two Grey Labyrinth largo operations (Twin-Flutter and Sloomber-Saber)
- Deploy Auto-Feeders IMMEDIATELY to prevent rare slime starvation
- Integrate elite slimes into automated ranch systems

**Key Success Metrics:**

- The Archway unlocked and fully developed (5 plots)
- Highest-value plort production active (Sloomber-Saber generates 900-1,500 NB/day)
- All Auto-Feeders operational to prevent rare slime starvation
- Total ranch revenue increased to 8,500-12,000+ Newbucks/day
- Grey Labyrinth plort stockpiling for Chapter 13-14

**Capital Requirements:**

- Archway Unlock: 2,800 Newbucks
- Full Build-Out: ~9,845 Newbucks (2 corrals + 1 coop + 1 garden + 1 silo)
- **Total Investment: ~12,645 Newbucks**
- Recommended Starting Budget: 15,000+ Newbucks

#### Phase 1: Unlock The Archway

**Capital Required:** 2,800 Newbucks

The Archway is accessed from the northwest corner of the Conservatory. This 5-plot expansion will become your Grey Labyrinth operations center.

**Location:** Northwest corner of the Conservatory (look for the stone archway near the northern cliffs)

#### Phase 2: Plot-by-Plot Build

Execute the following build in order:

**The Archway (5 plots - NEW EXPANSION):**

| **Plot** | **Type** | **Contents** | **Base Cost** | **Upgrades** | **Total Cost** | **Purpose/Notes** |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **1** | Garden | Polaricherry | 250 NB | Nutrient Soil (600), Sprinkler (700) | 1,550 NB | Feeds Plot 2. Polaricherry from Grey Labyrinth. 20 per harvest |
| **2** | Corral | Twin-Flutter Largos (6) | 250 NB | High Walls (260), Auto-Feeder (750), Plort Collector (750) | 2,010 NB | Produces Twin + Flutter Plorts. Feed Polaricherry (Twin favorite, 4 plorts/feeding). Revenue: ~100-150 NB/feeding. Flutter calming aura, Twin portals grab distant food |
| **3** | Coop | Candied Hens + Roostros | 250 NB | High Walls (200), Spring Grass (600), Vitamizer (700) | 1,750 NB | Feeds Plot 4. Stock: 6-8 hens + 2 roostros. Breeds continuously |
| **4** | Corral | Sloomber-Saber Largos (6) | 250 NB | High Walls (260), Music Box (350), Auto-Feeder (750), Plort Collector (750) | 2,360 NB | Produces Sloomber + Saber Plorts. Feed Candied Hens (Sloomber favorite, 4 plorts/feeding). Revenue: ~150-250 NB/feeding. **HIGHEST VALUE COMBO IN GAME**. Music Box CRITICAL - Sloomber clouds pacify Saber |
| **5** | Silo | Plort & Food Storage | 450 NB | Tier 1 (500), Tier 2 (575), Tier 3 (650) | 2,175 NB | Store Twin, Sloomber, Saber, Flutter plorts + Polaricherry/Candied Hen buffer. DO NOT put Grey Labyrinth plorts in Refinery yet (needed Ch 13-14) |

**Total Investment:** 2,800 NB (expansion) + 9,845 NB (plots/upgrades) = 12,645 NB

#### Phase 3: Key Notes

**Auto-Feeder Setup:**
- Plot 2 (Twin-Flutter): Polaricherry | Plot 4 (Sloomber-Saber): Candied Hens

**CRITICAL:**
- Music Box on Sloomber-Saber corral is essential (Saber aggression + Sloomber sleep clouds)
- Use Quantum Drones (from Chapter 9) to automate plort/food transport if desired

#### Phase 4: Infrastructure Gadgets (Optional Quality-of-Life)

**Market Link Placement:**
- **Location:** Central area of The Archway near Plots 2 and 4 (corrals)
- **Cost:** 250 NB + 20 Pink Plorts + 10 Buzz Wax + 10 Primordy Oil + 5 Silky Sand
- **Purpose:** Quickly sell Twin, Sloomber, and Saber plorts without traveling to Conservatory
- **Usage:** Can sell all plorts here OR store in Silo for later sale

**Refinery Link Placement:**
- **Location:** Near entrance from The Conservatory
- **Cost:** 250 NB + 10 Phosphor Plorts + 10 Jellystone + 5 Deep Brine

- **Cost:** 3,000 NB + 30 Hyper Plorts + 20 Tin Petal + 10 Aqua Glass + 10 Magma Comb + 2 Royal Jelly
- **Placement:** The Den ↔ The Archway
- **Why:** Connect eastern expansions (requires Hyper Plorts from Ch 12 or wild farming)

**9. Amber Teleporter - The Digsite ↔ Grey Labyrinth (if Chapter 12 built)**
- **Cost:** 4,000 NB + 30 Dervish Plorts + 20 Tin Petal + 10 Dream Bubble + 10 Aqua Glass + 2 Royal Jelly
- **Placement:** The Digsite ↔ Grey Labyrinth Terrarium
- **Why:** Direct access from weather slime operations to Hyper slime zone (ONLY if you built Ch 12)

**When to Craft:**
- Craft after establishing Archway operations (you'll have Twin Plorts)
- Grey Labyrinth resources available from Chapter 10 exploration
- Wait until you have 15,000+ NB surplus (don't delay Chapter 12-13 progress)

**Important Notes:**
- Each teleporter set creates TWO devices (you place both ends)
- Teleporters require line-of-sight between devices to function
- Cannot use teleporters while carrying Unstable items during Prisma Disruptions
- Different colored teleporters are independent networks (Gold teleporter only connects to other Gold teleporter)

### End of Chapter Completion Checklist

By the end of Chapter 11, you should have:
- ✅ The Archway expansion unlocked and operational
- ✅ Twin-Flutter Largos established in Plot 2
- ✅ Sloomber-Saber Largos established in Plot 4
- ✅ Auto-Feeders installed and stocked on both corrals

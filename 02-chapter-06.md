## Chapter 6: The Tidepools - Passive Income

**Mindset:** _Establish passive income streams._

Develop The Tidepools into a zero-maintenance division generating constant passive income while crafting Tier III upgrades.

### The Operational Blueprint

**Primary Objective:** Construct a fully passive income operation requiring minimal daily interaction

**Financial Checkpoint:**
- **Starting Budget:** Should have 25,000-30,000+ Newbucks from Chapter 5 operations
- **Required:** ~24,350 Newbucks for Tidepools unlock (6,000 NB), build-out (4,350 NB), and Tier III upgrades (14,000 NB)
- **Daily Revenue:** ~4,000-4,500 Newbucks from Conservatory + Gully
- **Timeline:** Achieve in 5-7 days through all operations
- **Farming Strategy:** If short on funds, spend 3-5 days farming plorts from both Conservatory and Gully operations while simultaneously harvesting resources from Ember Valley and Starlight Strand (Deep Brine, Silky Sand, Buzz Wax, Wild Honey, Primordy Oil) to stockpile materials for Tier III upgrades

**Strategic Priorities:**

- Unlock The Tidepools expansion (6,000 Newbucks - accessed through The Gully)
- Build dual Puddle Pond system (8 Puddle Slimes generating plorts from water alone)
- Establish dual Incinerator operations (10 Fire Slimes producing plorts from ash)
- Create ash production garden to fuel Fire Slime operations

**Key Success Metrics:**

- The Tidepools unlocked and fully developed (5 plots)
- Passive income: 1,540-2,310 Newbucks daily with only 10-15 minutes management
- Zero Tarr risk (Puddle and Fire Slimes cannot create Tarr)
- Tier III upgrades crafted: Tank Booster III, Power Core III, Heart Module III, Tank Guard II

**Capital Requirements:**

- Tidepools Unlock: 6,000 Newbucks
- Full Build-Out: ~4,350 Newbucks (all 5 plots with upgrades)
- Tier III Upgrades: ~14,000 Newbucks + materials
- **Total Investment: ~24,350 Newbucks**
- Recommended Starting Budget: 25,000+ Newbucks

### Strategic Priorities

1. **Unlock The Tidepools:** Purchase expansion access (6,000 NB) to establish passive income center.
2. **Deploy Puddle Ponds:** Install two Puddle Ponds (8 slimes total) for zero-maintenance plort generation.
3. **Deploy Fire Incinerators:** Install two Incinerators (10 Fire Slimes total) for low-maintenance income.
4. **Build Ash Production Garden:** Plant vegetables to generate ash for Fire Slime feeding.
5. **Craft Tier III Upgrades:** CRITICAL—Heart Module III, Tank Booster III, Power Core III required for Chapter 7 (Powderfall Bluffs).
6. **Establish Passive Income:** Create 1,540-2,310 NB/day revenue stream requiring only 10-15 minutes management.
7. **Zero Tarr Risk:** Puddle and Fire Slimes cannot create Tarr—safest operations on ranch.

### Financial Checkpoint

**Capital Required:**
- Tidepools Unlock: 6,000 Newbucks
- Full Build-Out: 4,350 Newbucks (5 plots with upgrades)
- Tier III Upgrades: 14,000 Newbucks + materials
- **Total: ~24,350 Newbucks**

**Revenue Impact:**
- **Starting:** ~4,000-4,500 Newbucks/day (Chapter 5: Conservatory + Gully)
- **After Expansion:** ~5,540-6,810 Newbucks/day (Conservatory + Gully + Tidepools combined)
- **Daily Increase:** +1,540-2,310 Newbucks/day
- **Return on Investment:** 10,350 NB (expansion + build) ÷ 1,925 NB/day = ~5.4 days to break even

**Strategic Note:** Tidepools passive income requires minimal daily interaction (10-15 minutes) while you explore Powderfall Bluffs in Chapter 7. Tier III upgrades are MANDATORY before entering aggressive Saber territory.

#### Phase 1: Unlock The Tidepools

**Objective:** Purchase The Tidepools expansion to establish passive income operations.

**Capital Required:** 6,000 Newbucks

The Tidepools is accessed from the far end of The Gully. This 5-plot expansion will become your ranch's passive income center.

**Location:** Far end of The Gully (must unlock Gully first) - coastal path leading to water

**Layout:** Seaside area with plots along rocky tidal formations. Beach aesthetic with ocean views and natural water sources.

#### Phase 2: Plot-by-Plot Build

**Objective:** Construct 5 plots in The Tidepools with passive income operations and ash production.

Execute the following build in order:

**The Tidepools (5 plots - NEW EXPANSION):**

| **Plot** | **Type** | **Contents** | **Base Cost** | **Upgrades** | **Total Cost** | **Purpose/Notes** |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **1** | Pond | Puddle Slimes (4) | 450 NB | None | 450 NB | Zero-maintenance passive income. Generates plorts from water. No feeding required |
| **2** | Pond | Puddle Slimes (4) | 450 NB | None | 450 NB | Zero-maintenance passive income. Generates plorts from water. No feeding required |
| **3** | Incinerator | Fire Slimes (5) | 450 NB | Ash Trough (500) | 950 NB | Low-maintenance income. Feed ash (throw veggies from Plot 5 into incinerator) |
| **4** | Incinerator | Fire Slimes (5) | 450 NB | Ash Trough (500) | 950 NB | Low-maintenance income. Feed ash (throw veggies from Plot 5 into incinerator) |
| **5** | Garden | Odd Onions (or any veggie) | 250 NB | Nutrient Soil (600), Sprinkler (700) | 1,550 NB | Ash production. Throw vegetables into incinerators to generate ash for Fire Slimes |

**Total Investment:** 6,000 NB (expansion) + 4,350 NB (plots/upgrades) = 10,350 NB

**Asset Acquisition:**
- **Puddle Slimes (8 total):** Starlight Strand (highest density) or Rainbow Fields. Cannot Largo, must use Pond plots
- **Fire Slimes (10 total):** Ember Valley lava pools. Cannot Largo, must use Incinerator plots

#### Phase 3: Key Notes

**Objective:** Understand passive income mechanics and establish low-maintenance operations.

**Passive Income System:**
- Puddle Slimes (Plots 1-2): Zero maintenance, generate plorts from water
- Fire Slimes (Plots 3-4): Throw vegetables from Plot 5 into incinerators to create ash
- Combined revenue: ~1,540-2,310 NB/day
- Time required: ~5-7 minutes every 1-2 days
- Zero Tarr risk

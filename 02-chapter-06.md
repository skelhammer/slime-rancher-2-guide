## Chapter 6: The Tidepools - Passive Income

**Mindset:** _Establish passive income streams._

Develop The Tidepools into a zero-maintenance division generating constant passive income while crafting Tier III upgrades.

### The Operational Blueprint

**Primary Objective:** Construct a fully passive income operation requiring minimal daily interaction

**Financial Checkpoint:**
- **Starting Budget:** Should have 25,000-30,000+ Newbucks from Chapter 5 operations
- **Required:** ~24,350 Newbucks for Tidepools unlock (6,000 NB), build-out (4,350 NB), and Tier III upgrades (14,000 NB)
- **Daily Revenue:** ~4,000-4,500 Newbucks from Conservatory + Gully
- **Timeline:** Achieve in 5-7 days through all operations
- **Farming Strategy:** If short on funds, spend 3-5 days farming plorts from both Conservatory and Gully operations while simultaneously harvesting resources from Ember Valley and Starlight Strand (Deep Brine, Silky Sand, Buzz Wax, Wild Honey, Primordy Oil) to stockpile materials for Tier III upgrades

**Strategic Priorities:**

- Unlock The Tidepools expansion (6,000 Newbucks - accessed through The Gully)
- Build dual Puddle Pond system (8 Puddle Slimes generating plorts from water alone)
- Establish dual Incinerator operations (10 Fire Slimes producing plorts from ash)
- Create ash production garden to fuel Fire Slime operations

**Key Success Metrics:**

- The Tidepools unlocked and fully developed (5 plots)
- Passive income: 1,540-2,310 Newbucks daily with only 10-15 minutes management
- Zero Tarr risk (Puddle and Fire Slimes cannot create Tarr)
- Tier III upgrades crafted: Tank Booster III, Power Core III, Heart Module III, Tank Guard II

**Capital Requirements:**

- Tidepools Unlock: 6,000 Newbucks
- Full Build-Out: ~4,350 Newbucks (all 5 plots with upgrades)
- Tier III Upgrades: ~14,000 Newbucks + materials
- **Total Investment: ~24,350 Newbucks**
- Recommended Starting Budget: 25,000+ Newbucks

### Accessing The Tidepools

Before you can begin development, you must unlock this expansion.

- **Location**: The entrance to The Tidepools is located at the far end of The Gully (must unlock The Gully first), marked by a coastal path leading to the water.
- **Unlock Cost**: 6,000 Newbucks
- **Layout**: The Tidepools is a seaside area with plots arranged along rocky tidal formations. Features natural water sources and a beach aesthetic with ocean views.

### Ranch Development & Plot Allocation: The Tidepools Build-Out (5 plots)

#### Phase 1: Passive Income Infrastructure

**Plot 1 (Pond): Puddle Pond Alpha (4 Slimes):**

- **Build Order:** Pond (450)
- **Total Investment:** 450 Newbucks
- **Feed Strategy:** None required (generates plorts passively from water)
- **Purpose:** Zero-maintenance passive income

**Plot 2 (Pond) Puddle Pond Beta (4 Slimes):**

- **Build Order:** Pond (450)
- **Total Investment:** 450 Newbucks

- **Purpose:** Zero-maintenance passive income

#### Phase 2: Fire Slime Operations

**Plot 3 (Incinerator): Incinerator Alpha (5 Slimes):**

- **Build Order:** Incinerator (450) → Ash Trough (500)
- **Total Investment:** 950 Newbucks
- **Feed Strategy:** Throw vegetables from Plot 5 garden into incinerator to generate ash
- **Purpose:** Low maintenance income from Fire Plorts

**Plot 4 (Incinerator): Incinerator Beta (5 Slimes):**

- **Build Order:** Incinerator (450) → Ash Trough (500)
- **Total Investment:** 950 Newbucks
- **Feed Strategy:** Throw vegetables from Plot 5 garden into incinerator to generate ash
- **Purpose:** Low maintenance income from Fire Plorts

#### Phase 3: Support Infrastructure

**Plot 5 (Garden): Ash Production Garden:**

- **Build Order:** Garden (250) → Nutrient Soil (600) → Sprinkler (700)
- **Total Investment:** 1,550 Newbucks
- **Crop:** Any fast-growing vegetable (Odd Onions recommended)

### Asset Acquisition

**Puddle Slimes (8 total):**
- **Location:** Starlight Strand (highest density) or Rainbow Fields
- **Notes:** Cannot Largo, must be stored in ponds, generate plorts passively from water (zero maintenance)

**Fire Slimes (10 total):**
- **Location:** Ember Valley lava pools
- **Notes:** Cannot Largo, must be stored in Incinerators, consume ash (throw vegetables into incinerator to generate ash)

### Upgrade Path for this Chapter (Priority Order)

This chapter combines infrastructure development (The Tidepools) with a major Tier III upgrade wave. Spread these investments strategically.

- **Tank Booster III** (3,000 Newbucks + 30 Tabby Plorts + 20 Angler Plorts + 30 Radiant Ore + 10 Lava Dust + 1 Storage Cell): Increases inventory capacity to 50 units per slot. This is the highest priority upgrade as it dramatically improves resource collection efficiency.
- **Power Core III** (3,000 Newbucks + 30 Cotton Plorts + 20 Batty Plorts + 10 Wild Honey + 30 Primordy Oil + 1 Power Chip): Boosts energy to 250, allowing for much longer Jetpack use. Essential for deep exploration of Powderfall Bluffs in Chapter 7.
- **Heart Module III** (3,000 Newbucks + 30 Pink Plorts + 20 Honey Plorts + 30 Deep Brine + 10 Silky Sand + 1 Heart Cell): Increases survivability by boosting health to 250. Critical for surviving Saber Slime encounters in Chapter 7.
- **Tank Guard II** (5,000 Newbucks + 30 Crystal Plorts + 20 Hunter Plorts + 20 Buzz Wax + 1 Strange Diamond + 1 Tank Liner): Upgrades salvage rate to 40% of tank contents upon taking damage. Provides excellent insurance during dangerous exploration.

**Total Investment:** ~14,000 Newbucks + extensive materials

### Additional Tidepools Tips

- **Passive Income Calculation:**
  - Puddle Slimes: 8 slimes × ~40 Newbucks × 2-3 plorts per day = ~640-960 Newbucks daily
  - Fire Slimes: 10 slimes × ~45 Newbucks × 2-3 plorts per day = ~900-1,350 Newbucks daily
  - Combined Total: ~1,540-2,310 Newbucks daily passive income
- **Time Efficiency:** Tidepools requires ~5-7 minutes every 1-2 days for collection and ash feeding. Highest profit-per-minute ratio in the game.
- **No Tarr Risk:** Neither Puddle Slimes nor Fire Slimes can create Tarr (no feeding/plort mixing for Puddles, Fire Slimes are isolated). This is the safest operation on your ranch.
- **Strategic Value:** Passive income funds exploration and upgrade costs without active ranching labor.
- **Access Route:** The Tidepools is accessed through The Gully.
- **Occasional Spawns:** Deep Brine occasionally spawns in The Tidepools, though Rainbow Fields (near water) is the primary farming location.

### Optional: Dash Pad Connection

**Cost:** 500 Newbucks + 10 Crystal Plorts + 10 Angler Plorts + 5 Lava Dust + 5 Silky Sand

**Placement:** Position 1 Dash Pad along the path between The Gully entrance and The Tidepools entrance

### Next Chapter Preparation

Chapter 7 explores Powderfall Bluffs to capture Saber Slimes and harvest critical endgame resources (Sun Sap, Perfect Snowflakes).

- **Equipment Check:** You should have all Tier III upgrades (Heart Module III, Power Core III, Tank Booster III, Tank Guard II) before entering Powderfall Bluffs. Aggressive Saber Slimes require maximum defensive capability.
- **Carnivore Supplies:** Stockpile 50+ meat (Thunderclucks preferred) to pop the Saber Gordo and capture wild Saber Slimes.
- **Access Route:** Locate the hidden waterfall entrance in southwestern Ember Valley.
- **Objective:** Capture 10-12 Saber Slimes and 20-30 Thunderclucks for Chapter 8's Den expansion. Harvest Sun Sap (ULTRA-RARE endgame resource) and mark all tree locations.

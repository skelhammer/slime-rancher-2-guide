## Chapter 6: The Tidepools - Passive Income

**Mindset:** _Establish passive income streams._

Develop The Tidepools into a zero-maintenance division generating constant passive income while crafting Tier III upgrades.

### The Operational Blueprint

**Primary Objective:** Construct a fully passive income operation requiring minimal daily interaction

**Financial Checkpoint:**
- **Starting Budget:** Should have 25,000-30,000+ Newbucks from Chapter 5 operations
- **Required:** ~24,350 Newbucks for Tidepools unlock (6,000 NB), build-out (4,350 NB), and Tier III upgrades (14,000 NB)
- **Daily Revenue:** ~4,000-4,500 Newbucks from Conservatory + Gully
- **Timeline:** Achieve in 5-7 days through all operations
- **Farming Strategy:** If short on funds, spend 3-5 days farming plorts from both Conservatory and Gully operations while simultaneously harvesting resources from Ember Valley and Starlight Strand (Deep Brine, Silky Sand, Buzz Wax, Wild Honey, Primordy Oil) to stockpile materials for Tier III upgrades

**Strategic Priorities:**

- Unlock The Tidepools expansion (6,000 Newbucks - accessed through The Gully)
- Build dual Puddle Pond system (8 Puddle Slimes generating plorts from water alone)
- Establish dual Incinerator operations (10 Fire Slimes producing plorts from ash)
- Create ash production garden to fuel Fire Slime operations

**Key Success Metrics:**

- The Tidepools unlocked and fully developed (5 plots)
- Passive income: 1,540-2,310 Newbucks daily with only 10-15 minutes management
- Zero Tarr risk (Puddle and Fire Slimes cannot create Tarr)
- Tier III upgrades crafted: Tank Booster III, Power Core III, Heart Module III, Tank Guard II

**Capital Requirements:**

- Tidepools Unlock: 6,000 Newbucks
- Full Build-Out: ~4,350 Newbucks (all 5 plots with upgrades)
- Tier III Upgrades: ~14,000 Newbucks + materials
- **Total Investment: ~24,350 Newbucks**
- Recommended Starting Budget: 25,000+ Newbucks

#### Phase 1: Unlock The Tidepools

**Capital Required:** 6,000 Newbucks

The Tidepools is accessed from the far end of The Gully. This 5-plot expansion will become your ranch's passive income center.

**Location:** Far end of The Gully (must unlock Gully first) - coastal path leading to water

**Layout:** Seaside area with plots along rocky tidal formations. Beach aesthetic with ocean views and natural water sources.

#### Phase 2: Plot-by-Plot Build

Execute the following build in order:

**The Tidepools (5 plots - NEW EXPANSION):**

| **Plot** | **Type** | **Contents** | **Base Cost** | **Upgrades** | **Total Cost** | **Purpose/Notes** |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **1** | Pond | Puddle Slimes (4) | 450 NB | None | 450 NB | Zero-maintenance passive income. Generates plorts from water. No feeding required |
| **2** | Pond | Puddle Slimes (4) | 450 NB | None | 450 NB | Zero-maintenance passive income. Generates plorts from water. No feeding required |
| **3** | Incinerator | Fire Slimes (5) | 450 NB | Ash Trough (500) | 950 NB | Low-maintenance income. Feed ash (throw veggies from Plot 5 into incinerator) |
| **4** | Incinerator | Fire Slimes (5) | 450 NB | Ash Trough (500) | 950 NB | Low-maintenance income. Feed ash (throw veggies from Plot 5 into incinerator) |
| **5** | Garden | Odd Onions (or any veggie) | 250 NB | Nutrient Soil (600), Sprinkler (700) | 1,550 NB | Ash production. Throw vegetables into incinerators to generate ash for Fire Slimes |

**Total Investment:** 6,000 NB (expansion) + 4,350 NB (plots/upgrades) = 10,350 NB

**Asset Acquisition:**
- **Puddle Slimes (8 total):** Starlight Strand (highest density) or Rainbow Fields. Cannot Largo, must use Pond plots
- **Fire Slimes (10 total):** Ember Valley lava pools. Cannot Largo, must use Incinerator plots

#### Phase 3: Automation Integration

**Puddle Pond Management:**
- Plots 1 & 2: Zero maintenance required
- Puddle Slimes generate plorts passively from water (no feeding needed)
- Simply collect plorts every 1-2 days
- Revenue: ~640-960 NB/day (8 slimes × 2-3 plorts/day)

**Incinerator Management:**
- Plots 3 & 4: Low maintenance required
- Throw vegetables from Plot 5 Garden into incinerators to create ash
- Fire Slimes consume ash and produce plorts
- Revenue: ~900-1,350 NB/day (10 slimes × 2-3 plorts/day)
- **Combined Tidepools Revenue: ~1,540-2,310 NB/day**

**Time Efficiency:**
- Requires only ~5-7 minutes every 1-2 days
- Highest profit-per-minute ratio in the game
- No Tarr risk (safest operation on ranch)

**Garden Restocking:**
- Plot 5 (Odd Onion Garden): Harvest every 2-3 in-game days
- Throw harvested vegetables directly into Incinerators (Plots 3 & 4)
- Ash Trough upgrade allows Fire Slimes to consume ash automatically

#### Phase 4: Infrastructure Gadgets (Optional Quality-of-Life)

**Market Link Placement:**
- **Location:** Central area near Ponds (Plots 1 & 2)
- **Cost:** 250 NB + 20 Pink Plorts + 10 Buzz Wax + 10 Primordy Oil + 5 Silky Sand
- **Purpose:** Quickly sell Puddle and Fire Plorts without traveling through Gully to Conservatory
- **Usage:** Sell all plorts from Tidepools operations here (no plorts need stockpiling)

**Refinery Link Placement:**
- **Location:** Near entrance from The Gully
- **Cost:** 250 NB + 10 Phosphor Plorts + 10 Jellystone + 5 Deep Brine
- **Purpose:** Convenient deposit point for resources collected during exploration
- **Note:** Tidepools primarily generates passive income, not exploration resources

**Dash Pad Placement:**
- **Location:** Path between The Gully entrance and Tidepools entrance
- **Cost:** 500 NB + 10 Crystal Plorts + 10 Angler Plorts + 5 Lava Dust + 5 Silky Sand
- **Purpose:** Sprint with zero energy cost between Gully and Tidepools

### Next Chapter Preparation

Chapter 7 explores Powderfall Bluffs to capture Saber Slimes and harvest critical endgame resources (Sun Sap, Perfect Snowflakes).

- **Equipment Check:** You should have all Tier III upgrades (Heart Module III, Power Core III, Tank Booster III, Tank Guard II) before entering Powderfall Bluffs. Aggressive Saber Slimes require maximum defensive capability.
- **Carnivore Supplies:** Stockpile 50+ meat (Thunderclucks preferred) to pop the Saber Gordo and capture wild Saber Slimes.
- **Access Route:** Locate the hidden waterfall entrance in southwestern Ember Valley.
- **Objective:** Capture 10-12 Saber Slimes and 20-30 Thunderclucks for Chapter 8's Den expansion. Harvest Sun Sap (ULTRA-RARE endgame resource) and mark all tree locations.

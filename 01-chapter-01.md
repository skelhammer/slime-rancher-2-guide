# Part 1: The Foundation (Chapters 1-4)

_This part focuses on establishing your initial ranch, acquiring the first two tiers of Vacpack upgrades, and unlocking the two primary mid-game biomes._

## Chapter 1: The Sprint to Mobility

**Mindset:** _Focus on mobility._

This is a 72-hour blitz with a single, non-negotiable objective: acquiring the key enabling technology of the Jetpack.

### The Operational Blueprint

**Primary Objective:** Craft the Jetpack and unlock vertical exploration

**Financial Checkpoint:**
- **Starting Budget:** 0 Newbucks (fresh start)
- **Required:** ~2,035 Newbucks for all upgrades and corral security
- **Timeline:** Achieve in 3-4 days through Tabby-Cotton plort sales

**Strategic Priorities:**

- Establish your first revenue stream with Tabby-Cotton Largos
- Secure mandatory foundation upgrades (Resource Harvester, Heart Module, Corral Security)
- Night hunt Phosphor Slimes and harvest Radiant Ore in Ember Valley
- Deploy capital into Jetpack, not additional plots

**Key Success Metrics:**

- Revenue stream active by end of Day 1
- 2,035+ Newbucks accumulated for all upgrades
- Jetpack crafted by Day 3-4

### Gordo Strategy

Pop the Pink Gordo to unlock the Ember Valley portal switch:

| **Gordo** | **Food Required** | **Location** | **Reward** |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Pink Gordo** | 30 Any (omnivore) | Rainbow Fields - Western area near slime statues | Geyser to Ember Valley portal switch |

### Slime Locations for Chapter 1

**Rainbow Fields Slimes:**

| **Slime** | **Diet** | **Favorite** | **Largo?** | **Location** | **Special Notes** |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Pink** | Omnivore | Any | YES | Everywhere in Rainbow Fields | Most common slime, eats anything |
| **Tabby** | Meat | Stony Hen | YES | Throughout starting area | Jumps frequently, needs High Walls |
| **Cotton** | Veggie | Water Lettuce | YES | Grassy areas throughout | Produces valuable Cotton Plorts |
| **Phosphor** | Fruit | Cuberry | YES | Throughout (NIGHT ONLY) | Glowing, requires Solar Shield in corrals, burns in sunlight |

#### Phase 1: Initial Asset Collection

Collect the slimes and resources needed for your first ranch operation.

**Slimes Needed:**
- 6 Tabby Slimes (throughout Rainbow Fields starting area)
- 6 Cotton Plorts (from wild Cotton Slimes in grassy areas)

**Food Stockpile:**
- 20+ Water Lettuce (wild patches near water throughout Rainbow Fields)

**Collection Strategy:**
- Capture 6 Tabby Slimes first
- Collect 6 Cotton Plorts from wild Cotton Slimes
- Feed Cotton Plorts to Tabby Slimes to create Tabby-Cotton Largos
- Harvest Water Lettuce to stockpile for initial feeding

#### Phase 2: Plot-by-Plot Build

Execute the following Conservatory build:

| **Plot** | **Type** | **Contents** | **Base Cost** | **Upgrades** | **Total Cost** | **Purpose/Notes** |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **1** | Corral | Tabby-Cotton Largos (6) | 250 NB | High Walls (260), Air Net (425) | 935 NB | Produces Tabby + Cotton Plorts. Feed Water Lettuce (Cotton favorite, 4 plorts/feeding) |
| **2** | Garden | Water Lettuce | 250 NB | None yet | 250 NB | Feeds Plot 1. Will add Nutrient Soil + Sprinkler in Chapter 2 |
| **3-8** | EMPTY | - | - | - | - | Strategic hold - conserve capital for Jetpack |

**Total Investment:** 1,185 NB (plots/upgrades)

#### Phase 3: Unlock Ember Valley

Pop the Pink Gordo to unlock access to Ember Valley for Radiant Ore collection (see Gordo Strategy table above for details).

**Why Ember Valley?**
- Radiant Ore spawns abundantly here (required for Jetpack crafting)
- Provides access to additional resources for future chapters

#### Phase 4: Resource Gathering for Jetpack

**Night Hunt - Phosphor Slimes:**
- Wait for nighttime in Rainbow Fields
- Hunt Phosphor Slimes (spawn near central mountain and western areas)
- Collect 10 Phosphor Plorts (DO NOT ranch them yet - requires Solar Shield which costs 425 NB)
- Return before dawn (they burn in sunlight)

**Ember Valley - Radiant Ore:**
- Enter Ember Valley through portal (after popping Pink Gordo)
- Harvest 10 Radiant Ore from glowing pink/magenta crystal nodes
- **CRITICAL:** Must craft Resource Harvester first (see Phase 5)

#### Phase 5: Vacpack Upgrades (Priority Order)

| **Upgrade** | **Cost** | **Materials** | **Effect** | **Priority** |
|-------------|----------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| **Resource Harvester** | 450 NB | 10 Cotton Plort | Harvest science resources from nodes | **CRAFT FIRST** - Required for Radiant Ore collection |
| **Heart Module** | 450 NB | 10 Pink Plort | 100 → 150 HP | HIGH - Essential for Ember Valley survival |
| **Jetpack** | 450 NB | 10 Phosphor Plort, 10 Radiant Ore | Unlocks personal jetpack | **PRIMARY GOAL** - Enables vertical exploration |

**Additional Corral Upgrades:**
- High Walls (260 NB) + Air Net (425 NB) = 685 NB total - Prevents Largo escapes during exploration

**Total Investment:** ~1,585 NB (upgrades) + 685 NB (corral security) = ~2,270 NB
**Grand Total (Plots + Upgrades):** ~3,455 NB

**Crafting Order:**
1. Resource Harvester (enables Radiant Ore collection)
2. Corral Security (High Walls + Air Net - prevents escapes)
3. Heart Module (survivability for Ember Valley)
4. Jetpack (unlocks vertical exploration)

#### Phase 6: Core Mechanics

**Creating Largos:**
- Feed a slime a different plort type to convert it
- Example: Tabby Slime + Cotton Plort = Tabby-Cotton Largo
- Largos produce 2 plort types

**Refinery vs Plort Market:**
- **Refinery** (in Lab): Deposit plorts for crafting upgrades - **CANNOT withdraw**
- **Plort Market:** Sell plorts for Newbucks

**Key Details:**
- Optimal corral population: 6 Largos (8-10 regular slimes)
- Water Lettuce is Cotton favorite (4 plorts per feeding)

### End of Chapter Completion Checklist

- **Primary Revenue Stream:** One corral established with 6 Tabby-Cotton Largos ✅
- **Gordo Target:** Pink Gordo popped and Ember Valley portal switch activated ✅
- **Essential Upgrades Crafted:**
  - Resource Harvester ✅
  - Heart Module (150 HP) ✅
  - Jetpack ✅
- **Corral Security:** High Walls and Air Net installed on your main corral ✅

### Next Chapter Preparation

Chapter 2 expands the Conservatory to 4 plots, unlocks Starlight Strand, and crafts Power Core and Tank Booster upgrades.

- **Financial Goal:** Save at least 4,500 Newbucks for Phosphor-Honey corral operation (2,110 NB), garden (1,550 NB), and upgrades (900 NB).
- **Gordo Preparation:** Stockpile 30 vegetables (or 15 Water Lettuce) to pop the Cotton Gordo, which unlocks Starlight Strand.
- **Asset Collection:** You'll capture Phosphor and Honey Slimes from Starlight Strand for a new Phosphor-Honey Largo operation.

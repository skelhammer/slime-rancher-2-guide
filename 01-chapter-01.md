# Part 1: The Foundation (Chapters 1-4)

_This part focuses on establishing your initial ranch, acquiring the first two tiers of Vacpack upgrades, and unlocking the two primary mid-game biomes._

## Chapter 1: The Sprint to Mobility

**Mindset:** _Focus on mobility._

This is a 72-hour blitz with a single, non-negotiable objective: acquiring the key enabling technology of the Jetpack.

### The Operational Blueprint

**Primary Objective:** Craft the Jetpack and unlock vertical exploration

**Financial Checkpoint:**
- **Starting Budget:** 0 Newbucks (fresh start)
- **Required:** ~2,035 Newbucks for all upgrades and corral security
- **Timeline:** Achieve in 3-4 days through Tabby-Cotton plort sales

**Strategic Priorities:**

- Establish your first revenue stream with Tabby-Cotton Largos
- Secure mandatory foundation upgrades (Resource Harvester, Heart Module, Corral Security)
- Night hunt Phosphor Slimes and harvest Radiant Ore in Ember Valley
- Deploy capital into Jetpack, not additional plots

**Key Success Metrics:**

- Revenue stream active by end of Day 1
- 2,035+ Newbucks accumulated for all upgrades
- Jetpack crafted by Day 3-4

### Gordo Strategy

**Pink Gordo:**
- **Location:** Rainbow Fields - Western area near slime statues
- **Food:** Any (30 total)
- **Reward:** Geyser to Ember Valley portal switch

### Slime Locations for Chapter 1

- **Pink Slimes:** Everywhere in Rainbow Fields (most common slime)
- **Tabby Slimes:** Rainbow Fields, commonly found throughout the starting area
- **Cotton Slimes:** Rainbow Fields, found in grassy areas throughout the map
- **Phosphor Slimes:** Rainbow Fields, spawn ONLY at night, recognizable by glowing cores and wings

### Ranch Development & Plot Allocation (Conservatory - 8 plots)

**Core Operation (Plots 1 & 2):**

**Plot 1 (Corral):** Your Tabby-Cotton Largo Division (6 slimes)

- **Build Order:** Corral (250) → High Walls (260) → Air Net (425)
- **Total Investment:** 935 Newbucks
- **Feed Strategy:** Water Lettuce (Cotton favorite food, produces 2 Tabby + 2 Cotton plorts per feeding)

**Plot 2 (Garden):** Water Lettuce garden for Tabby-Cotton Largos

- **Build Order:** Garden (250)
- **Total Investment:** 250 Newbucks
- **Crop:** Water Lettuce (Cotton favorite food)

**Strategic Hold (Plots 3-8):**

- Do not purchase any additional plots. All capital is conserved for the primary mission: crafting the Jetpack.

### Upgrade Path for this Chapter (Priority Order)

- **Resource Harvester** (450 Newbucks + 10 Cotton Plorts): Without this, you cannot harvest Radiant Ore or any science resources needed for the Jetpack. CRAFT THIS FIRST.
- **Heart Module** (450 Newbucks + 10 Pink Plorts): Increases max health from 100 to 150. Essential for survivability in Ember Valley.
- **Corral Security Complete:** High Walls (260 Newbucks) + Air Net (425 Newbucks) = 685 Newbucks total. Purchase these NOW to prevent Largo escapes while you're away gathering Phosphor Plorts.
- **Jetpack** (450 Newbucks + 10 Phosphor Plorts + 10 Radiant Ore): The ultimate goal of this chapter. Enables vertical exploration and access to previously unreachable areas. Hunt Phosphor Slimes at night in Rainbow Fields - they spawn consistently near the central mountain and western areas.

**Total Investment:** ~2,035 Newbucks + materials

### Additional Early Game Tips

**Creating Largos:**
- Feed a slime a different plort type to convert it into a Largo (e.g., feed a Tabby Slime a Cotton Plort to create a Tabby-Cotton Largo). Largos produce 2 plort types and are 2x more valuable than regular slimes.

**Inventory & Storage:**
- You start with 4 inventory slots at 20 units each (80 total capacity). Tank Booster in Chapter 2 increases this to 30 units per slot (120 total).
- The Refinery is located in The Lab beneath the Conservatory. Deposit plorts and resources there before crafting upgrades at the Fabricator.
- **IMPORTANT:** Plorts deposited into the Refinery CANNOT be withdrawn. Only deposit plorts you need for crafting upgrades, not for selling.
- To sell plorts: Deposit them directly into the Plort Market (the machine with the rainbow plort icon).

**Corral Management:**
- Optimal population: 8-10 regular slimes OR 6 Largos per fully upgraded corral. Overcrowding causes agitation and reduced productivity.
- Install High Walls and Air Net (see upgrade path above) to prevent escapes while you explore.
- Auto-Feeders must be manually restocked. Plort Collectors must be manually emptied. No automatic transfers exist between plots.

**Resource Collection:**
- Phosphor Slimes spawn only at night throughout Rainbow Fields (recognizable by glowing cores and wings).
- Radiant Ore spawns randomly on Rainbow Island but is abundant in Ember Valley (look for glowing pink/magenta crystal nodes after getting Resource Harvester).
- Phosphor Slimes require Solar Shield (425 NB) + High Walls + Air Net when ranched (prevents disappearing in sunlight).

### End of Chapter Completion Checklist

- **Primary Revenue Stream:** One corral established with 6 Tabby-Cotton Largos ✓
- **Gordo Target:** Pink Gordo popped and Ember Valley portal switch activated ✓
- **Essential Upgrades Crafted:**
  - Resource Harvester ✓
  - Heart Module (150 HP) ✓
  - Jetpack ✓
- **Corral Security:** High Walls and Air Net installed on your main corral ✓

### Next Chapter Preparation

Chapter 2 expands the Conservatory to 4 plots, unlocks Starlight Strand, and crafts Power Core and Tank Booster upgrades.

- **Financial Goal:** Save at least 4,500 Newbucks for Phosphor-Honey corral operation (2,110 NB), garden (1,550 NB), and upgrades (900 NB).
- **Gordo Preparation:** Stockpile 30 vegetables (or 15 Water Lettuce) to pop the Cotton Gordo, which unlocks Starlight Strand.
- **Asset Collection:** You'll capture Phosphor and Honey Slimes from Starlight Strand for a new Phosphor-Honey Largo operation.

# Appendix E: Craftable Gadgets & Warp Tech

Quick reference guide for all craftable gadgets, utilities, warp technology, and slime toys in Slime Rancher 2.

## Slime Toys

**Added in Patch 1.1.0 (Toys, Trimmings, and Tune-Ups):** Every slime type now has a favorite toy. Toys reduce slime agitation when placed in corrals. Favorite toys provide a 25% agitation reduction (vs. 12.5% for non-favorite toys). Some special toys cause "curious effects" beyond agitation reduction.

Toys are purchased from **ProntoMart's Coo-Coo Corner**. One toy is guaranteed available for purchase daily.

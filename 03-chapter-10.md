## Chapter 10: The Grey Labyrinth - Elite Asset Acquisition

**Mindset:** _Strategic endgame extraction._

The Grey Labyrinth is Rainbow Island's most dangerous zone and contains the rarest, most valuable slimes in the game. This chapter focuses on entering the Labyrinth, understanding its mechanics, and extracting breeding stock of elite slimes to integrate into your automated ranch operations.

### Prerequisites: Equipment & Entry Requirements

Before entering the Grey Labyrinth, verify you have the required equipment and understand the entry mechanics.

#### Required Vacpack Status (from Chapter 9)

By the end of Chapter 9, you should have:
- **Health/Energy:** Heart Module III (250 HP), Power Core III (250 Energy)
- **Mobility:** Jetpack II, Dash Boots II
- **Inventory/Defense:** Tank Booster III, Extra Tank, Tank Guard, Water Tank, Pulse Wave

#### Key Gadget: The Radiant Projector

The Radiant Projector is essential for solving light puzzles that lock the main entrance to the Grey Labyrinth.

**Blueprint Source:** Viktor Humphries (NPC scientist) gives you the blueprint via a comm station call.

**Unlock Requirements:** Viktor's call triggers automatically when you meet BOTH conditions:
- You have popped either the Boom Gordo (Ember Valley) OR the Flutter Gordo (Starlight Strand)
- It is at least Day 20 of your playthrough (in-game days)

**Timeline If Following This Guide:**
- Chapter 3 (Days 8-12): You pop the Boom Gordo in Ember Valley
- Chapter 4 (Days 13-17): You pop the Flutter Gordo in Starlight Strand
- Day 20: Viktor's comm station call triggers automatically
- Day 20+: Radiant Projector blueprint becomes available at your Fabricator

**Radiant Projector Crafting Recipe:**
- **Cost:** 500 Newbucks
- **Materials:** 10 Hunter Plorts, 10 Boom Plorts, 5 Silky Sand, 5 Lava Dust
- **Quantity:** Craft 3-4 Radiant Projectors before entering
- **Reusability:** Radiant Projectors can be picked up and reused, but having multiple allows you to solve complex multi-mirror puzzles without backtracking

#### Required Expedition Kit

Bring the following items in your inventory:
- **Entry Tools:** 3-4 crafted Radiant Projectors
- **Puzzle Items:** Stack of Hunter Plorts and Angler Plorts (for Terrarium access later)
- **Plort Statues (CRITICAL if entering from Starlight Strand):** 1 Boom Plort and 1 Batty Plort - there are plort statue doors very close to the Starlight Strand entrance that unlock shortcuts and valuable areas
- **Utility:** Full stack of throwable items (Pink Plorts work well) for farming Shadow Slimes

### The Operational Blueprint

#### Phase 1: Initial Entry & Intelligence Gathering

**Objective:** Enter the Grey Labyrinth, activate Map Data Nodes, and understand the zone mechanics.

**Entry Points:**
- **Ember Valley:** Portal revealed after popping the Boom Gordo (western volcanic area)
- **Starlight Strand:** Portal revealed after popping the Flutter Gordo (southern central cave) - RECOMMENDED

**Entry Puzzle (Starlight Strand Route):**

The door to the Grey Labyrinth is located directly under where the Flutter Gordo was positioned. You need 2 Radiant Projectors:

1. **First Projector:** Capture the yellow light beam emanating from the nearby Slime Statue
2. **Second Projector:** Bounce the captured light to the triangle-shaped light switch/sensor on the door
3. When correctly aligned, the beam turns YELLOW and the door opens

**Map Data Nodes:**

The Grey Labyrinth contains 7 Map Data Nodes across all zones. Your FIRST priority upon entering is finding and activating these nodes:

**Map Data Node Locations:**
- 2 nodes in Waterworks (hub area)
- 2 nodes in Impossible Sky
- 1 node in Lava Depths
- 1 node in Dream Land
- 1 node in Terrarium

Reference appendix-locations.md for exact locations once you're exploring.

**Initial Exploration Actions:**
- Enter the Labyrinth and immediately begin searching for Map Data Nodes
- Observe Prisma Disruption patterns (don't engage yet)
- Locate new slime species (Twin, Shadow) and resource nodes
- Mark positions for future targeted runs
- Return to your portal and extract once map is active

#### Phase 2: Understanding Grey Labyrinth Mechanics

**Key Zones Overview:**

- **Waterworks (Hub):** Central aquatic hub with pipes and waterworks infrastructure. Contains Aqua Glass nodes (ONLY source in Labyrinth). Best entry point via Starlight Strand portal. Multiple locked rooms opened by plort statues. Connects to all major zones.
- **Impossible Sky:** Grassy overgrown area with ruinous architecture. Contains Twin Slimes, Polaricherry trees, Black Indigonium nodes, and Royal Jelly. Features three plort statues (Shadow, Twin, Sloomber). Twin Gordo located here (unlocks portal to Rainbow Fields). The gilded area near Prismacore is part of this zone.
- **Lava Depths:** Volcanic area with Magma Comb resource nodes. Accessed via Ember Valley portal with Radiant Projector puzzle. Contains 3 Rock plort statues and 1 Boom plort statue for shortcuts. Heavily stacked vertical rooms make navigation difficult.
- **Dream Land:** Largest northern area with magenta vegetation, windmills, and Royal Jelly. Divided into 3 sub-areas:
  - Central: First arrival point from Impossible Sky (no Sloomber/Candied Hens)
  - North: Contains Sloomber Gordo (portal to Conservatory). Requires Radiant Projector puzzle or pipes from east
  - West: Requires Radiant Projector puzzle (4+ projectors) or flying from north. Contains Shadow Plort Door shortcut to Waterworks
- **Terrarium:** Sealed greenhouse biodome containing plants/food/slimes from most Rainbow Island regions. ONLY natural spawn of Hyper Slimes and Turbo Taters. Contains Hyper Gordo. **Access requires:** 3 Radiant Projectors, 1 Hunter Plort, 1 Angler Plort (entry puzzle at Lava Depths/Impossible Sky transition).
- **Prismacore:** Final zone accessed via plort statue doors (Twin, Shadow, Sloomber required). Contains Gigi's exchange station and story finale. (Chapter 14 content)

**Critical Hazards:**

**Prisma Disruptions:** Reality-altering energy waves that periodically sweep through zones. During disruptions, all loose food and plorts become "Unstable."

**Disruption Hazards:** During active disruptions, dangerous plasma/flame energy erupts from cracks in the ground. These energy geysers deal significant damage on contact. Avoid standing near ground cracks during disruptions.

**Unstable Items:** Items with "Unstable" status randomly JUMP out of your Vacpack unpredictably. They pop out if you take damage and eventually vanish if left unstabilized. **CRITICAL:** You cannot use teleporters/warp depots while carrying Unstable items.

**Stabilization Methods:**
- **Prisma Stabilizers:** Yellow floating portals that appear during disruptions. Shoot Unstable items through them to stabilize. **One-time use** - they disappear after use.
- **Stabilizing Gates:** Permanent archway structures found throughout Labyrinth. Walk through with Unstable items in vac to stabilize them. Reusable.
- **Result:** Unstable Plorts → Prisma Plorts (1 Unstable Plort typically becomes 1-2 Prisma Plorts when stabilized, with 2 being common)

**No Slime Sea:** The bottom of the Labyrinth is a cloud ocean. Anything that falls in is PERMANENTLY LOST. There is no recovery.

**Tarr Risk:** Very common due to high slime variety and abundant food. Water Tank strongly recommended.

**Dream Land Trap Warning:** If you enter Dream Land North via pipes without unlocking west Radiant Projector puzzle and lack Jetpack II mobility, you can get trapped. Escape options: Emergency Return (Tank Guard), pop Sloomber Gordo, or complete puzzle.

#### Phase 3: New Slime Species & Resources

**Grey Labyrinth Slimes:**

| **Slime** | **Diet** | **Favorite** | **Largo?** | **Location** | **Special Notes** |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Shadow** | None | N/A | NO | Dark corners throughout | Cannot be vacuumed. Cannot be eaten by Tarr. Spawns in groups of 2-5. Produces plorts when hit by ANY thrown object (item not consumed). Jumps when disturbed, then vanishes. |
| **Twin** | Fruit | Polaricherry | YES | Impossible Sky, throughout | Alternates blue/pink states. Creates portals to snag distant food. |
| **Sloomber** | Meat | Candied Hen | YES | Dream Land (North/West) | Emits sleep cloud that calms or incapacitates other slimes. |
| **Hyper** | Veg | Turbo Tater | YES | Terrarium ONLY | Extremely fast, ricochets constantly. Requires maximum corral security. |

**Exclusive Resources:**

- **Harvestable Nodes:** Magma Comb (Lava Depths), Tin Petal, Black Indigonium (Impossible Sky), Aqua Glass (Waterworks ONLY), Dream Bubble (Dream Land)
- **New Foods:** Polaricherry (Fruit - Twin favorite), Candied Hen (Meat - Sloomber favorite), Turbo Tater (Vegetable - Hyper favorite)
- **Prisma Plort:** Crafted resource created by stabilizing Unstable Plorts (NOT a slime species)

**Shadow Plort Doors:**

The 25 Shadow Plort Doors are the Grey Labyrinth's equivalent of Treasure Pods:
- **Visual:** Shaped like Refinery Links with sun-meter dial above
- **Map Icon:** Moon/Sun symbols (black and yellow pokeball-like icon)
- **Opening:** Deposit Shadow Plorts into door. Sun meter transitions to night-time (crescent moon), then unlocks
- **Costs:** 25-100 Shadow Plorts per door (varies)
- **Total Count:** 25 doors (19 in main areas, 6 in Terrarium)
- **Rewards:** Blueprints, upgrade components (Storage Cells, Power Chips), decorations, shortcuts
- **Total Needed:** 1,165 Shadow Plorts to open all 25 (Chapter 13 objective)

#### Phase 4: Asset Acquisition - Capturing Elite Slimes

**Objective:** Capture breeding stock of Twin, Sloomber, and Hyper slimes and collect their favorite foods.

**Gordo Locations & Rewards:**

Pop these three Gordos to unlock permanent portals and collect slimes:

| **Gordo** | **Food Required** | **Location** | **Reward** |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Twin Gordo** | 50 Fruit (Polaricherry counts 2x) | Impossible Sky | 12 Twin Slimes + 1 jar + Portal to Rainbow Fields |
| **Sloomber Gordo** | 30 Meat (Candied Hen counts 2x) | Dream Land (North) | 12 Sloomber Slimes + 1 jar + Portal to Conservatory (formerly led to Terrarium pre-v1.0) |
| **Hyper Gordo** | 30 Veggies (Turbo Tater counts 2x) | Terrarium | 12 Hyper Slimes + 1 jar + Key switch for progression |

**Capture Strategy:**

Conduct separate, targeted runs for each slime type:

**Twin Slimes:**
- **Location:** Impossible Sky (easiest access from Waterworks)
- **Target:** Capture 10-12 Twin Slimes
- **Food Collection:** Collect 40-60 Polaricherry from trees in Impossible Sky
- **Method:** Pop Twin Gordo first (50 Fruit) to get 12 free Twin Slimes, then collect Polaricherry
- **Transport:** Return to ranch via portal (Starlight Strand → Conservatory)

**Sloomber Slimes:**
- **Location:** Dream Land North/West (requires Radiant Projector puzzle or Gordo portal)
- **Target:** Capture 10-12 Sloomber Slimes
- **Food Collection:** Collect 40-60 Candied Hens from Dream Land
- **Method:** Pop Sloomber Gordo first (30 Meat) to get 12 free Sloomber Slimes and unlock Conservatory portal
- **Transport:** Return to ranch via Conservatory portal (very convenient)

**Hyper Slimes:**
- **Location:** Terrarium ONLY (requires solving Radiant Projector puzzle at Lava Depths/Impossible Sky transition)
- **Puzzle Requirements:** 3 Radiant Projectors + 1 Hunter Plort + 1 Angler Plort
- **Target:** Capture 10-12 Hyper Slimes
- **Food Collection:** Collect 40-60 Turbo Taters from Terrarium gardens
- **Method:** Pop Hyper Gordo first (30 Veggies) to get 12 free Hyper Slimes
- **Warning:** Hyper Slimes are EXTREMELY bouncy and fast. Keep them contained in your vac during transport.
- **Transport:** Return to ranch via nearest portal

**Storage on Ranch:**

You won't build The Archway expansion until Chapter 11. For now, store these slimes temporarily:
- Use empty corrals in The Den or other expansions
- Do NOT create Largos yet (wait for Chapter 11 strategic planning)
- Store favorite foods in Silos for later use

#### Phase 5: Shadow Plort & Prisma Plort Farming (Basic Introduction)

**Objective:** Understand how to farm Shadow Plorts and Prisma Plorts for future chapters.

**Shadow Plort Farming:**

Shadow Slimes are unique - they cannot be vacuumed or captured, but they produce plorts when hit:

**How to Farm Shadow Plorts:**
1. Shadow Slimes spawn in groups of 2-5 in dark corners throughout Grey Labyrinth
2. Carry a full stack of throwable items (Pink Plorts, vegetables, anything)
3. Hit Shadow Slimes with thrown objects
4. They produce Shadow Plorts on the ground (thrown item is NOT consumed)
5. Vacuum up the Shadow Plorts
6. Shadow Slime jumps erratically, then vanishes
7. Return later - Shadow Slimes respawn in same locations

**Optimal Farming Route:**
- Systematically visit all dark corners in Waterworks, Impossible Sky, Lava Depths, Dream Land
- Carry 100 throwable items, farm all Shadow Slimes, return to ranch
- Repeat runs as needed

**Shadow Plort Uses:**
- 1,165 for opening all 25 Shadow Plort Doors (Chapter 13)
- 20 for Nullifier crafting (Chapter 14)
- **Total needed: 1,185 Shadow Plorts**

**CRITICAL - Store Shadow Plorts in SILOS, not Refinery** (cannot use Refinery plorts to open doors)

**Prisma Plort Farming (Basic Method):**

Prisma Plorts are created by stabilizing Unstable Plorts during Prisma Disruptions:

**Temporary Pink Slime Farm Setup:**
1. Bring 50 Pink Slimes from ranch to Grey Labyrinth
2. Set up near a Stabilizing Gate in Waterworks (main hub)
3. Place Pink Slimes in temporary open area (no corral needed)

**Operation During Disruption:**
1. Collect Unstable food (fruits, veggies, chickens) during Prisma Disruption
2. Feed Pink Slimes immediately
3. They produce Unstable Plorts
4. Walk through Stabilizing Gate with Unstable Plorts in vac
5. They convert to stable Prisma Plorts (1 Unstable Plort → 1-2 Prisma Plorts, typically 2)
6. Deposit to nearby Refinery Link or return to ranch
7. When done farming, vacuum up Pink Slimes and return them to ranch
8. Avoid standing near ground cracks during disruptions (plasma/flame energy geysers)

**Prisma Plort Uses:**
- 90 total for Gigi's milestone trades (Chapter 14)
- 155 total for crafting upgrades (145 Vacpack upgrades + 10 Disruption Detector)
- **Total needed: ~245 Prisma Plorts (requires ~123-245 Unstable Plorts depending on conversion rate)**

**CRITICAL - Store Prisma Plorts in SILOS, not Refinery** (cannot trade Refinery plorts to Gigi)

**Advanced Farming Note:**
- Open early Shadow Plort Doors (25-50 plort cost) for shortcuts and quality-of-life improvements
- Unlock Stabilizing Gate blueprint (75 Shadow Plorts) to craft permanent gate at ranch for convenient Prisma Plort farming
- Systematic door completion is Chapter 13 objective

#### Phase 6: Warp Infrastructure Setup

**Objective:** Establish permanent one-way warp infrastructure in the Grey Labyrinth for efficient resource farming and emergency extraction.

The Grey Labyrinth is vast and dangerous. Setting up strategic warp gadgets dramatically improves farming efficiency and provides critical safety nets for exploration.

**Deploy Three Key Gadgets:**

**1. Refinery Link (Resource Deposit)**

- **Crafting Cost:** 250 Newbucks + 10 Phosphor Plorts + 10 Jellystone + 5 Deep Brine
- **Location:** Waterworks central hub (near main Stabilizing Gate)
- **Placement Notes:** Place near the large central Stabilizing Gate archway where you'll be conducting Prisma Plort farming operations
- **Why This Location:**
  - Waterworks is the central hub connecting to all major Grey Labyrinth zones
  - Quick deposit access for Shadow Plorts collected throughout entire Labyrinth
  - Adjacent to Prisma Plort farming operation (temporary Pink Slime setup)
  - Allows fast inventory dumps during extended exploration without abandoning position
  - Central position minimizes travel time from any farming route

**2. Market Link (Plort Sales)**

- **Crafting Cost:** 250 Newbucks + 20 Pink Plorts + 10 Buzz Wax + 10 Primordy Oil + 5 Silky Sand
- **Location:** Impossible Sky (near Twin Gordo area)
- **Placement Notes:** Place in the grassy area near where the Twin Gordo was located, central to the Impossible Sky zone
- **Why This Location:**
  - Impossible Sky is a major farming zone (Twin Slimes, Polaricherry, Black Indigonium, Royal Jelly)
  - Direct market access for high-value Twin Plorts while farming
  - This zone connects to Prismacore area (used in Chapter 14 endgame)
  - You'll spend significant time here during Chapter 11+ operations
  - Allows immediate plort sales during farming runs to keep inventory clear

**3. Yellow Home Portal (Emergency Extraction)**

- **Crafting Cost:** 250 Newbucks + 10 Cotton Plorts + 5 Jellystone + 5 Deep Brine
- **Location:** Terrarium (sealed biodome with Hyper Slimes)
- **Placement Notes:** Place near the center of the Terrarium biodome, accessible from the main entrance
- **Why This Location:**
  - Terrarium is the most isolated zone in the Grey Labyrinth
  - Requires complex puzzle access (3 Radiant Projectors + 1 Hunter Plort + 1 Angler Plort)
  - Only natural spawn location for Hyper Slimes and Turbo Taters
  - Provides emergency extraction from the furthest point in the Labyrinth
  - Yellow Home Portal is the cheapest option (250 NB) and hasn't been used in previous chapters
- **One-Way Function:** Teleports you instantly back to Conservatory (does not allow return travel)

**Total Investment:** 750 Newbucks + materials

**Benefits:**
- **Refinery Link:** Eliminates inventory management trips during Shadow Plort farming runs
- **Market Link:** Allows immediate plort sales without leaving farming zones
- **Yellow Home Portal:** Critical safety net for Terrarium operations and emergency extraction

**When to Deploy:**
- Craft and deploy all three gadgets during Phase 1-2 (Initial Entry & Intelligence Gathering)
- Having infrastructure in place before deep exploration prevents inventory frustration
- Emergency extraction (Yellow Home Portal) is especially critical before attempting Terrarium puzzle access

**Note About Two-Way Teleporters:**
- In Chapter 11, you'll have access to colored Teleporters (two-way travel)
- The Gold Teleporter (Conservatory ↔ Grey Labyrinth Waterworks) will be your primary fast-travel system
- These one-way gadgets (Refinery Link, Market Link, Home Portal) complement the two-way teleporter network
- Keep both systems - one-way gadgets provide utility (deposit/sell/extract), teleporters provide navigation

### Strategic Priorities

1. **Map First, Always:** Do not operate in unmapped territory. Activate all 7 Map Data Nodes before deep exploration.
2. **Pop Gordos for Portals:** Twin Gordo (Rainbow Fields), Sloomber Gordo (Conservatory), Hyper Gordo (key switch) - these portals save massive time.
3. **Capture Breeding Stock:** 10-12 of each elite slime type (Twin, Sloomber, Hyper) is sufficient for ranch operations.
4. **Collect Favorite Foods:** 40-60 of each food type (Polaricherry, Candied Hen, Turbo Tater) for Chapter 11 buildout.
5. **Farm Shadow Plorts Opportunistically:** Start collecting Shadow Plorts now for Chapter 13 door opening (1,165 total needed).
6. **Store Plorts in Silos:** NEVER put Shadow/Prisma Plorts in Refinery until you've completed door/milestone objectives.
7. **Do Not Ranch Here:** Grey Labyrinth is an extraction zone, not a ranching expansion. Capture assets and return to your secure ranch.

### Financial Checkpoint

**Capital Required:**
- Radiant Projectors: 2,000 Newbucks (4 × 500)
- Warp Infrastructure: 750 Newbucks (Refinery Link + Market Link + Yellow Home Portal)
- Materials: Hunter/Boom Plorts, Silky Sand, Lava Dust, Phosphor Plorts, Pink Plorts, Cotton Plorts (from existing operations)
- **Total: ~2,750 Newbucks**

**No Direct Revenue Added:**

This chapter is about resource gathering and asset acquisition, not revenue generation. The captured elite slimes will generate revenue in Chapter 11 (The Archway) when properly integrated into ranch operations.

**Estimated Revenue from Chapter 11 Preview:**
- Twin-Flutter Largos: ~100-150 Newbucks per feeding
- Sloomber-Saber Largos: ~150-250 Newbucks per feeding
- **Combined Archway Revenue: +2,000-3,500 Newbucks/day** (Chapter 11)

### End of Chapter Checklist

By the end of Chapter 10, you should have:
- ✅ All 7 Grey Labyrinth Map Data Nodes activated
- ✅ Twin Gordo popped (50 Fruit) - Portal to Rainbow Fields unlocked
- ✅ Sloomber Gordo popped (30 Meat) - Portal to Conservatory unlocked

- ✅ Warp infrastructure deployed (Refinery Link in Waterworks, Market Link in Impossible Sky, Yellow Home Portal in Terrarium)
- ✅ Ready to build The Archway expansion (Chapter 11)

### Next Chapter Preparation

With elite Grey Labyrinth slimes captured and favorite foods collected, you're ready to integrate these valuable assets into your ranch operations. Chapter 11 (The Archway - Grey Labyrinth Operations) will establish the highest-value plort production on your entire ranch using Twin-Flutter and Sloomber-Saber Largo combinations.

**Preparation for Chapter 11:**
- Have 12,650 Newbucks saved (Archway expansion + upgrades)
- Verify you have 10-12 Twin, Sloomber slimes stored
- Verify you have Polaricherry, Candied Hen stocks
- Have Saber Slimes available (from Chapter 7 Powderfall Bluffs operations)
- Have Flutter Slimes available (from Chapter 4 Starlight Strand operations)

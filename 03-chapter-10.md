## Chapter 10: The Archway - Rare Slimes

**Mindset:** _Capture rare slime species._

Establish operations for Dervish and Tangle slimes - the final two pre-Labyrinth species missing from your empire.

### The Operational Blueprint

**Primary Objective:** Establish operations for Dervish and Tangle slimes with optimal Largo combinations

**Financial Checkpoint:**
- **Starting Budget:** Should have 70,000-100,000+ Newbucks from Chapter 9 automated operations
- **Required:** ~20,000 Newbucks for Archway unlock (2,800 NB), build-out (12,000 NB), and optional 4th Quantum Drone (20,000 NB if purchasing vs hunting)
- **Daily Revenue:** ~10,500-14,500 Newbucks from all automated operations
- **Timeline:** Achieve in 2-3 days through fully automated ranch
- **Farming Strategy:** With automation in place, ranch generates income passively. Focus exploration time on capturing Dervish and Tangle slimes from Starlight Strand during weather events while simultaneously harvesting rare resources

**Strategic Priorities:**

- Unlock The Archway expansion (2,800 Newbucks)
- Capture Dervish Slimes from Starlight Strand
- Capture Tangle Slimes from Starlight Strand
- Build Dervish-Ringtail Largo operation (high-value fruit division)
- Build Boom-Tangle Largo operation (elite carnivore division)
- Establish Painted Hen breeding facility (Tangle's favorite food)
- Deploy strategic resource silo and Quantum Drone automation

**Key Success Metrics:**

- The Archway unlocked with 5 plots developed
- Dervish-Ringtail Largos operational (high-value fruit plorts)
- Boom-Tangle Largos operational (elite carnivore plorts)
- Painted Hen breeding facility producing favorite food
- Quantum Drone fully automating The Archway operations
- Daily revenue from Archway: 2,000-3,000+ Newbucks

**Capital Requirements:**

- Archway Unlock: 2,800 Newbucks
- Full Build-Out: ~11,000-12,000 Newbucks (2 corrals, 1 coop, 1 garden, 1 silo with upgrades)
- Quantum Drone Station: 5,000 Newbucks + 100 Flutter Plorts + materials
- Recommended Starting Budget: 20,000+ Newbucks total

**Strategic Value:**

- Completes your pre-Labyrinth slime collection (all common and rare slimes ranched)
- Dervish plorts (~75 NB) + Ringtail plorts (~moderate value) = high-value production
- Boom plorts (~30-50 NB) + Tangle plorts (~75 NB) = ~105-125 NB per feeding
- Combined daily output: 2,000-3,000+ Newbucks from this expansion

### Accessing The Archway

Before you can begin development, you must unlock this expansion.

- **Location:** Northern side of the Conservatory, marked by ancient stone archway structures
- **Unlock Cost:** 2,800 Newbucks
- **Layout:** 5 plots arranged among grass-covered ruins with stone pillars and natural vegetation

### Phase 1: Asset Acquisition

Before building, capture the slimes you need.

**For Dervish-Ringtail Largos:**

- **6 Dervish Slimes:** Starlight Strand eastern windy cliffs during cyclones - fast, create tornadoes, use Pulse Wave
- **6 Ringtail Plorts:** From wild Ringtail Slimes (spawn at night in multiple biomes)

**For Boom-Tangle Largos:**

- **6 Boom Slimes:** Ember Valley volcanic areas
- **6 Tangle Plorts:** From wild Tangle Slimes in Starlight Strand during pollen storms

**Additional Resources:**

- 20-30 Painted Hens (Starlight Strand during weather events - for Tangle's favorite food)
- 30+ Prickle Pears (for Dervish-Ringtail feeding - from Starlight Strand or Ember Valley)

### Ranch Development & Plot Allocation: The Archway Build-Out (5 plots)

#### Phase 1: Fruit Division - Dervish-Ringtail Largos

**Plot 1 (Corral): Dervish-Ringtail Largo Division (6 largos)**

- **Build Order:** Corral (250) → High Walls (260) → Air Net (425) → Solar Shield (425) → Plort Collector (750) → Auto-Feeder (750) → Music Box (350)
- **Total Investment:** 3,210 Newbucks
- **Creation:** Deploy 6 Dervish Slimes, feed 6 Ringtail Plorts to create Dervish-Ringtail Largos
- **Feed Strategy:** Prickle Pears from Plot 4 (Dervish's favorite food)
- **Note:** Solar Shield required for Ringtail component (turns to stone in sunlight)

**Plot 4 (Garden): Prickle Pear Production**

- **Build Order:** Garden (250) → Nutrient Soil (600) → Sprinkler (700)
- **Total Investment:** 1,550 Newbucks
- **Crop:** Prickle Pears (Dervish's favorite food)
- **Purpose:** Feeds Plot 1 Dervish-Ringtail Largos with favorite food bonus
- **Output:** Sufficient Prickle Pears for 2-3 feedings per day

#### Phase 2: Carnivore Division - Boom-Tangle Largos

**Plot 2 (Corral): Boom-Tangle Largo Division (6 largos)**

- **Build Order:** Corral (250) → High Walls (260) → Air Net (425) → Plort Collector (750) → Auto-Feeder (750) → Music Box (350)
- **Total Investment:** 2,785 Newbucks
- **Creation:** Deploy 6 Boom Slimes, feed 6 Tangle Plorts to create Boom-Tangle Largos
- **Feed Strategy:** Painted Hens from Plot 3 (Tangle's favorite food)

**Plot 3 (Coop): Painted Hen Breeding Facility**

- **Build Order:** Coop (250) → High Walls (200) → Spring Grass (425) → Vitamizer (500) → Elder Collector (1,300)
- **Total Investment:** 2,675 Newbucks
- **Deployment:** 8-10 Painted Hens + 2 Roostros
- **Purpose:** Dedicated Painted Hen supply for Tangle's favorite food bonus
- **Production:** Sustainable rare chicken production with minimal intervention
- **Collection:** Elder Collector automates harvesting at end of lifespan
- **Note:** Painted Hens appear during specific weather events in Starlight Strand

#### Phase 3: Support Infrastructure

**Plot 5 (Silo): Strategic Plort & Food Storage**

- **Build Order:** Silo (450) → Storage Tier 1 (500) → Storage Tier 2 (575) → Storage Tier 3 (650)
- **Total Investment:** 2,175 Newbucks

**Storage Allocation:**

- Slots 1-4: High-Value Plorts (Dervish, Tangle, Boom, Ringtail) for price monitoring
- Slots 5-12: Food Reserves (Painted Hens, Prickle Pears, Thunderclucks, Sea Hens for other operations)

**Purpose:** Plort storage for price monitoring and specialty food distribution

**Note:** All resources and crafting materials should be stored in the Refinery (999 capacity per item), NOT in silos

### Quantum Drone Automation for The Archway

**Drone 4 - Archway Plort Collection (Recommended)**

If you have a 4th Quantum Drone (purchased from ProntoMart for 20,000 NB or found in exploration zones), The Archway benefits from automation:

**Station Location:** The Archway - central area

**Programming:**
- **Target:** Plorts
- **Source:** Plort Collector
- **Destination:** Silo (for price monitoring and bulk sales during price spikes)

**Result:** Continuously collects ALL plorts from Dervish-Ringtail and Boom-Tangle corrals and stores them

**Expected Result:** All plorts automatically collected and stored for price spike selling

**Note:** You'll need to manually feed the corrals for favorite food bonuses. Food automation is NOT recommended here since drone would distribute to ALL auto-feeders (both Dervish-Ringtail and Boom-Tangle corrals), losing favorite food optimization.

**Battery Management:** Charge with Boom Plorts or Ringtail Plorts (medium value) - 15-20 plorts keeps drone running for weeks

### Additional Archway Management Tips

**Dervish-Ringtail Largo Management:**

- Dervish component creates tornadoes that can knock plorts around
- Ringtail turns to stone in sunlight - Solar Shield is MANDATORY
- Music Box helps calm Dervish's tornado behavior
- Prickle Pear feeding: 4 plorts per feeding (2 Dervish + 2 Ringtail with favorite food bonus)
- High Walls + Air Net + Solar Shield + Music Box = secure containment

**Boom-Tangle Largo Management:**

- Boom explosions + Tangle vines = highly active corral
- Music Box is MANDATORY for both components
- Painted Hen feeding: 4 plorts per feeding (2 Boom + 2 Tangle with favorite food bonus)
- High Walls + Air Net + Music Box = secure containment
- Explosions are harmless but can scatter plorts - Plort Collector essential

**Painted Hen Breeding Optimization:**

- Maintain 2 Roostros per 8-10 Hens
- Painted Hens are RARE - only spawn during specific weather events in Starlight Strand
- Elder Collector automatically harvests at end of lifespan
- Check collector every 1-2 days if not using Quantum Drone
- Once you have breeding population, they reproduce normally in coop

**Market Strategy:**

- Store Dervish, Tangle, Boom, and Ringtail plorts in Plot 5 Silo
- Monitor Plort Market daily for price spikes (150%+)
- Execute bulk sell-offs during spike events for 2,000-4,000 NB bonus transactions

**Resource Patches:**

- **3 Pogofruit patches:** Convenient fruit source for general use
- **2 Carrot patches:** Backup veggie source available in expansion
- **1 Jellystone node:** Occasional crafting material spawn

### Optional: Dash Pad Connection

**Cost:** 500 Newbucks + 10 Crystal Plorts + 10 Angler Plorts + 5 Lava Dust + 5 Silky Sand

**Placement:** Position 1 Dash Pad along the path between Conservatory entrance and The Archway entrance

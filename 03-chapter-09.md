# Part 3: Automation & Empire Completion (Chapters 9-11)

_This part implements total ranch automation through Quantum Drones, unlocks the final two ranch expansions (The Archway and The Digsite), and completes your pre-Labyrinth slime collection. Your ranch transforms from a manually-managed operation into a fully automated empire capable of generating 100,000+ Newbucks per week with minimal intervention._

## Chapter 9: Quantum Drones - Ranch Automation

**Mindset:** _Automate everything._

Deploy Quantum Drones to eliminate manual labor and transform your ranch from a hands-on operation into a fully automated empire.

### The Operational Blueprint

**Primary Objective:** Deploy 3 Quantum Drone Stations to automate core ranch operations

**Financial Checkpoint:**
- **Starting Budget:** Should have 50,000-70,000+ Newbucks from Chapter 8 operations
- **Required:** ~15,000 Newbucks for 3 Quantum Drone Stations
- **Optional:** ~1,500 Newbucks for catch-up Dash Pad crafting (if you skipped earlier chapters)
- **Daily Revenue:** ~6,500-8,500 Newbucks from all operations
- **Materials Required:** 300 Flutter Plorts (from Ch8 operations), 6 Strange Diamonds, 45 Lava Dust, 45 Wild Honey
- **Timeline:** Achieve in 3-5 days through all operations
- **Farming Strategy:** If short on Flutter Plorts, continue ranching Flutter-Phosphor (Den) and Flutter-Honey (Conservatory) operations for 3-5 days while simultaneously hunting Ghostly Drones in ranch expansions and wild zones

**Strategic Priorities:**

- Hunt Ghostly Drones in ranch expansions to obtain Drone Station Modules
- Accumulate 300 Flutter Plorts for 3 Quantum Drone Stations
- Gather Strange Diamonds and other crafting materials
- Craft 3 Quantum Drone Stations (5,000 NB each + materials)
- Program drones for Conservatory, Gully, and Tidepools plort collection automation
- Optional: Catch up on Dash Pads if you skipped them in Chapters 5, 6, and 8

**Key Success Metrics:**

- 3 Ghostly Drones found and Drone Station Modules obtained
- 3 Quantum Drone Stations crafted and deployed
- Conservatory fully automated (Drone 1)
- Gully plort collection automated (Drone 2)
- Tidepools fully automated (Drone 3)
- Daily ranch management time reduced from 30+ minutes to <10 minutes

**Capital Requirements:**

- Drone Station crafting: 15,000 Newbucks (3 × 5,000 NB)
- Flutter Plorts: 300 total (3 × 100 per station)
- Strange Diamonds: 6 total (3 × 2 per station)
- Lava Dust: 45 total (3 × 15 per station)
- Wild Honey: 45 total (3 × 15 per station)
- Recommended Starting Budget: 20,000+ Newbucks

**Critical Pre-Requisite:**

You should have 300+ Flutter Plorts accumulated from multiple sources: your current Flutter-Phosphor (Den Plot 2) and Flutter-Honey (Conservatory Plot 7) operations established in Chapter 8, plus stockpile from the Flutter-Tabby operation (Chapter 5-7, liquidated in Chapter 8). If you don't have enough Flutter Plorts yet, continue ranching for a few more in-game days until you reach 300.

### Phase 1: Understanding Quantum Drones

**What Are Quantum Drones?**

Quantum Drones are advanced automation devices that handle ranch tasks automatically. Each Quantum Drone Station comes with its own paired drone that can:

- Collect items from designated sources (corrals, coops, gardens)
- Transport items to designated destinations (silos, auto-feeders, market links)
- Operate continuously once programmed
- Teleport instantly between locations (no travel time)
- Work in two modes: Rancher Mode (ranch automation) or Explorer Mode (wild resource harvesting)

**How Quantum Drones Work:**

**Two Operating Modes:**

- **Rancher Mode (Placed in Conservatory/Expansions):**
  - Program with Target → Source → Destination logic
  - Example: "Collect Plorts from Plort Collector → Deposit in Plort Market"
  - Handles all ranch automation: plort collection, sales, transfers
  - Instantly teleports between locations (no travel time)
- **Explorer Mode (Placed in the Wild):**
  - Generates "quantum" resources based on the biome/area where drone is placed
  - **IMPORTANT:** Does NOT collect from actual resource nodes - resources are generated from "quantum" sources
  - Generates plorts, minerals, spouts, and hive materials automatically over time
  - Deposits into shared **Quantum Cloud** inventory (max 9,999 items)
  - Access Quantum Cloud from ANY Drone Station anywhere on the ranch
  - Items in Quantum Cloud can be:
    - Withdrawn to your inventory
    - Sold directly on the Market
    - Sent directly to the Refinery for crafting
  - Passive resource generation while you're away or exploring
  - Location determines WHAT resources are generated (e.g., Ember Valley = Lava Dust, Radiant Ore)

**Battery System:**

- Runs on plorts: 0%-100% (green bar) with overcharge to 999% (golden bar)
- Initial battery percentage when placing new station: 24%
- Higher battery % = faster operation speed
- Feed plorts to the Drone Station to recharge the battery
- **Battery does NOT drain when drone has no tasks to perform**
- Battery only drains when drone is actively executing programmed tasks
- Picking up a station resets battery to 24%

**Plort Charge Percentages:**

| Plort Type | Charge (under 100%) | Overcharge (100% → 999%) |
|---|---|---|
| Pink, Cotton, Tabby, Phosphor | 7% | 7% → 1% |
| Batty | 8% | 8% → 1% |
| Rock, Honey, Angler | 9% | 9% → 2% |
| Crystal, Hunter, Boom | 11% | 11% → 2% |
| Ringtail | 12% | 12% → 2% |
| Saber | 13% | 13% → 3% |
| Flutter | 14% | 14% → 3% |
| Tangle, Dervish, Puddle, Fire | 15% | 15% → 3% |
| Twin, Sloomber, Hyper | 17% | 17% → 4% |
| Yolky | 18% | 18% → 5% |
| Shadow | 20% | 20% → 10% |
| Prisma | 22% | 22% → 7% |
| Gold | 60% | 60% → 20% |

**Tip:** Keep a stockpile of cheap plorts (Pink, Cotton, Tabby - 7%) for routine recharges; save expensive plorts (Gold - 60%, Shadow - 20%, Prisma - 22%) for maximum overcharge speed

**Programming Interface:**

Each drone program has THREE components: **Target → Source → Destination**

Access via any Drone Station to configure:

**1. Target (What to collect):**
- **Plorts** (collects all plort types)
- **Veggies** (collects all vegetable types)
- **Fruit** (collects all fruit types)
- **Meat** (collects all chicken/meat types)
- **Elder Chickens** (collects only elder chickens)
- **Specific Plort Types** (e.g., only Tabby Plorts, only Crystal Plorts)
- **Specific Food Types** (e.g., only Pogofruit, only Stony Hens)

**2. Source (Where to collect from):**
- **When Target = Plorts:** Corral, Pond, Incinerator, Silo, Plort Collector, Free Range
- **When Target = Veggies:** Garden, Silo, Outside Plots
- **When Target = Fruit:** Garden, Silo, Outside Plots
- **When Target = Meat/Elder Chickens:** Coop, Silo, Outside Plots
- **IMPORTANT:** Sources collect from ALL instances of that type (e.g., "Coop" = all coops in expansion, not a specific plot)

**3. Destination (Where to deliver):**
- **When Target = Plorts:** Silo, Plort Market, Refinery
- **When Target = Veggies/Fruit/Meat:** Corral, Silo, Auto-Feeder, Incinerator (to make ash)
- **IMPORTANT:** Destinations deliver to ALL instances of that type (e.g., "Auto-Feeder" = all auto-feeders randomly, not a specific plot)

**IMPORTANT:** Drones operate continuously once programmed and only work while you're actively playing (not when game is closed)

**Explorer Mode:** Can ONLY be used outside The Conservatory (in wild biomes)

**CRITICAL - General vs Specific Targets:**

**General Targets (Recommended for Plorts):**
- **Target: Plorts** + **Source: Plort Collector** = Collects ALL plorts from ALL plort collectors in expansion
- This is the most efficient setup for plort collection
- Future-proof: automatically includes new plots with plort collectors

**Specific Targets (For Selective Collection):**
- **Target: Tabby Plorts** + **Source: Plort Collector** = Collects ONLY Tabby Plorts
- **Target: Stony Hens** + **Source: Coop** = Collects ONLY Stony Hens
- Useful when you want to separate plort types or food types

**CRITICAL - Food Distribution to Auto-Feeders:**
- **Target: Meat/Fruit/Veggies** + **Destination: Auto-Feeder** = Drone delivers to ALL auto-feeders in the expansion randomly
- **You CANNOT specify which auto-feeder** - it distributes to all of them
- This means it WON'T respect favorite food preferences and you'll lose the 4-plort bonus from favorite foods
- **Recommendation:** Manually feed for maximum efficiency, use drones ONLY for plort collection

**Important Limitation:**

Drones can only operate within the same expansion. A drone stationed in The Gully can only collect from and deliver to locations within The Gully. It cannot transfer items to the Conservatory or Tidepools. Plan your drone placements accordingly - you need one drone per expansion for automation.

### Phase 2: Finding Ghostly Drones

**What Are Ghostly Drones?**

Ghostly Drones are ethereal, semi-transparent phantom drones that roam Rainbow Island. They appear as translucent, floating machines that phase in and out of visibility. When you interact with one, it gives you a Drone Station Module (required to craft Quantum Drone Stations) and then disappears permanently.

**Confirmed Ghostly Drone Locations:**

There are **10 total Ghostly Drones** across Rainbow Island and the Grey Labyrinth. For Chapter 9, you only need 3 modules to craft your first 3 Quantum Drone Stations.

**Ranch Expansions (3 Drones - Easiest to Find):**
- **First Ranch Expansion:** 1 Ghostly Drone guaranteed spawn in whichever expansion you unlocked first (The Gully, The Archway, or The Den)
- **The Tidepools:** 1 Ghostly Drone spawn
- **The Digsite:** 1 Ghostly Drone spawn (unlocked in Chapter 11 - skip for Chapter 9, only 3 drones needed)

**Wild Zones (4 Drones - Moderate Difficulty):**
- **Rainbow Fields:** Tallest mountain summit in the middle (requires advanced jetpack)
- **Starlight Strand:** By the big two-colored tree (pink/blue biome junction)
- **Ember Valley:** Oasis on top of northernmost mountain (above Powderfall Bluffs entrance)
- **Powderfall Bluffs:** Off on the icy island to the northwest (difficult to reach)

**Grey Labyrinth (3 Drones - Endgame):**
- **Terrarium:** The new area on the far right
- **Dreamland:** High tower in the pink area (requires platforming)
- **Prismacore:** Flying around the portal/staircase area

**Recommendation for Chapter 9:** Hunt the 3 easiest drones from your available ranch expansions (First Expansion, Tidepools, and one from wild zones like Starlight Strand). The Digsite drone is not available until Chapter 11. Save Grey Labyrinth drones for later chapters when you need additional stations.

**How to Capture Ghostly Drones:**

1. Approach the Ghostly Drone (within 5 meters)
2. Press the interact button (same as opening doors/treasure pods)
3. A brief animation plays - you receive 1 Drone Station Module
4. The Ghostly Drone disappears permanently (will not respawn)
5. Check your inventory to confirm you received the module

### Phase 3: Crafting Quantum Drone Stations

Once you have all materials, craft your three Drone Stations at the Fabricator in the Lab (beneath Conservatory).

**Recipe Per Station:** 5,000 Newbucks + 100 Flutter Plorts + 15 Lava Dust + 15 Wild Honey + 2 Strange Diamonds + 1 Drone Station Module

Each station comes with its own paired Quantum Drone.

### Phase 4: Priority Quantum Drone Deployments

Now deploy and program your three drones to automate the most time-consuming ranch tasks.

**Drone 1 - Conservatory Automation (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**

**Purpose:** Automate your main 8-plot operation - the largest and most valuable area on your ranch

**Station Location:** Conservatory - central area

**Programming:**
- **Target:** Plorts
- **Source:** Plort Collector
- **Destination:** Plort Market (for immediate sales) OR Silo (for price spike management)

**Result:** Continuously collects ALL plorts from ALL plort collectors in the Conservatory (all 4 corrals) and sells or stores them

**Expected Result:** Your 8-plot Conservatory (Tabby-Cotton, Phosphor-Honey, Crystal-Rock, Flutter-Honey) operates with minimal intervention, generating 3,000-4,000+ NB/day

**Note:** You'll need to manually feed corrals for favorite food bonuses. If you want food automation, see warning below about auto-feeder limitations.

**Battery Management:** Charge with Pink Plorts or Cotton Plorts (abundant from Conservatory) - 20-30 plorts keeps this drone running for weeks

---

**Drone 2 - Gully Plort Collection**

**Purpose:** Automate plort collection from Gully's carnivore operations

**Station Location:** The Gully - central area

**Programming:**
- **Target:** Plorts
- **Source:** Plort Collector
- **Destination:** Plort Market (for immediate sales) OR Silo (for price monitoring)

**Result:** Continuously collects ALL plorts from both corrals (Angler-Crystal and Saber-Hunter) and sells or stores them

**Expected Result:** The Gully's carnivore operations (Angler, Crystal, Saber, Hunter plorts) automatically harvested, generating 2,000-3,000+ NB/day

**Note:** You'll need to manually feed both corrals with their favorite foods (Thunderclucks to Saber-Hunter, Sea Hens to Angler-Crystal) for maximum plort production. Food automation is NOT recommended here since drone would distribute to ALL auto-feeders randomly, losing favorite food bonuses.

**Battery Management:** Charge with Crystal Plorts or Hunter Plorts (medium-high value) - 15-20 plorts keeps this drone running for weeks

---

**Drone 3 - Tidepools Passive Income Automation**

**Purpose:** Fully automate the Tidepools passive income operation (1,540-2,310 NB/day)

**Station Location:** The Tidepools - central area

**Programming:**
- **Target:** Plorts
- **Source:** Plort Collector (collects from Ponds and Incinerators)
- **Destination:** Plort Market (for immediate sales) OR Silo (for storage)

**Result:** Continuously collects ALL plorts from both Puddle Ponds and both Fire Incinerators and sells or stores them

**Expected Result:** Tidepools generates 1,540-2,310 NB/day with ZERO manual intervention

**Note:** Tidepools requires minimal additional work - just throw vegetables into incinerators every 2-3 days to generate ash for Fire Slimes

**Battery Management:** Charge with Pink Plorts (cheap and abundant) - 10-15 plorts keeps this drone running for weeks

---

### Advanced Automation: Drones 4-6 (Optional - Future Chapters)

Once you progress through the game, you'll have access to 7 more Ghostly Drones (4 in wild zones + 3 in Grey Labyrinth). Here are optimal setups for complete ranch automation:

**Drone 4 - Den Automation**

**Purpose:** Automate The Den's nocturnal operations for plort collection

**Station Location:** The Den - central area

**Programming:**
- **Target:** Plorts
- **Source:** Plort Collector
- **Destination:** Plort Market (for immediate sales)

**Result:** Continuously collects ALL plorts from all three corrals (Boom-Batty, Flutter-Phosphor, Batty-Ringtail) and sells them

**Expected Result:** The Den's three nocturnal operations automatically harvest plorts and sell them, generating 2,000-3,000+ NB/day

**Note:** This drone collects ALL plorts including Flutter Plorts and sells them immediately. If you want to save Flutter Plorts for future drone crafting, manually collect them before the drone runs, or use a separate drone programmed specifically for Flutter Plorts → Refinery.

**Battery Management:** Charge with Boom Plorts or Flutter Plorts (medium value) - 15-20 plorts keeps this drone running for weeks

---

**Drone 5 - Archway Plort Collection (Chapter 10+)**

**Purpose:** Automate plort collection from Archway's rare slime operations

**Station Location:** The Archway - central area

**Programming:**
- **Target:** Plorts
- **Source:** Plort Collector
- **Destination:** Silo (store high-value plorts for price spike selling)

**Result:** Continuously collects ALL plorts from Dervish-Ringtail and Boom-Tangle corrals and stores them

**Expected Result:** Archway plorts automatically collected while you manage feeding and monitor prices

**Note:** You'll need to manually feed the Archway corrals for favorite food bonuses. Food automation is NOT recommended here since drone would distribute to ALL auto-feeders (both Dervish-Ringtail and Boom-Tangle corrals), losing favorite food optimization.

**Battery Management:** Charge with Honey or Dervish Plorts

---

**Drone 6 - Digsite Plort Collection (Chapter 11+)**

**Purpose:** Automate plort collection from Tabby-based Largo operations

**Station Location:** The Digsite - central area

**Programming:**
- **Target:** Plorts
- **Source:** Plort Collector
- **Destination:** Silo (for price monitoring and storage)

**Result:** Continuously collects ALL plorts from Tabby-Saber and Tabby-Boom corrals and stores them

**Expected Result:** Tabby plorts, Saber plorts, and Boom plorts automatically collected

**Note:** You'll need to manually feed the Digsite corrals for favorite food bonuses. Both corrals share the same favorite food (Stony Hens from the coop).

**Alternative - Food Automation (ACCEPTABLE HERE):** Since both corrals eat the SAME favorite food (Stony Hens), you CAN automate:
- **Target:** Stony Hens (specific food type)
- **Source:** Coop
- **Destination:** Auto-Feeder
- **Result:** Distributes Stony Hens to ALL auto-feeders (both Tabby-Saber and Tabby-Boom corrals)
- **Why This Works:** Both largos have Tabby as a component, so Stony Hens are the favorite food for BOTH - you don't lose the 4-plort bonus!

**Battery Management:** Charge with Tabby Plorts (cheap and abundant)

### Automation Best Practices

**Programming Tips:**

- Plort collection is the most useful automation - prioritize this for all expansions first
- You can place multiple drones in one expansion to handle different tasks (e.g., one for plorts, one for specific food types)
- Test new programs for 1-2 in-game days before relying on them completely
- Drones can't transfer items between different expansions - each drone only works within its own expansion
- For price-spike selling, program drones to deposit plorts into Silos instead of Market Links for storage

**Common Issues:**

- **Drone sits idle:** Check that Source and Destination are in same expansion, verify the source has items available to collect
- **Battery drains too fast:** Feed more plorts to the Drone Station to recharge the battery
- **Items not collected:** Ensure Source type matches Target (e.g., don't target "Meat" if there are no coops in the expansion)
- **Drone not working:** Verify you're actively playing - drones only work while game is running, not when closed

### Optional: Dash Pad Completion Check

**Purpose:** Verify you have Dash Pads connecting all expansion areas

**Previous Opportunities:** If you followed the optional Dash Pad sections in Chapters 5, 6, 8, 10, and 11, you should already have:
- 1 Dash Pad: Conservatory ↔ The Gully (Chapter 5)
- 1 Dash Pad: The Gully ↔ The Tidepools (Chapter 6)
- 1 Dash Pad: Conservatory ↔ The Den (Chapter 8)
- 1 Dash Pad: Conservatory ↔ The Archway (Chapter 10) - *not yet unlocked at this chapter*
- 1 Dash Pad: The Den ↔ The Digsite (Chapter 11) - *not yet unlocked at this chapter*

**Catch-Up Crafting (If You Skipped Earlier):**

If you didn't build Dash Pads in previous chapters, now is a good time to add them:

**Blueprint Unlock:** Ember Valley treasure pod (Chapter 3) - "Inside a hole in a rock pillar by a lone geyser"

**Crafting Cost:** 500 Newbucks + 10 Crystal Plorts + 10 Angler Plorts + 5 Lava Dust + 5 Silky Sand

**How Dash Pads Work:**
- Step on a Dash Pad to gain a temporary buff (~10-15 seconds)
- While buffed, sprinting costs ZERO energy
- Allows unlimited sprinting with no energy drain
- Extremely useful for long-distance ranch traversal

**Recommended Placements:**
- Between major expansion entrances (Conservatory, Gully, Tidepools, Den)
- Inside large expansions for faster plot-to-plot travel

**Investment:** 500 Newbucks per Dash Pad × 3 current expansions = ~1,500 Newbucks (if catching up)

### Next Chapter Preparation

With your core ranch operations automated, you can now focus on endgame content without worrying about daily ranch management.

**Chapter 10 Preparation:**

- **Financial Target:** Continue accumulating wealth - drones generate 6,500-8,500 NB/day automatically
- **Flutter Plort Accumulation:** Your Flutter operations continue producing - stockpile for future drone expansions (need 300 more Flutter Plorts for Drones 4-6)
- **Exploration Focus:** With ranch automated, dedicate time to treasure pod hunting and resource stockpiling
- **Future Drones (4-10):** Hunt the remaining 7 Ghostly Drones for expanded automation:
  - 4 drones in wild zones (Rainbow Fields, Starlight Strand, Ember Valley, Powderfall Bluffs)
  - 3 drones in Grey Labyrinth (endgame content)
  - **Alternative:** Purchase Drone Station Modules from ProntoMart:
    - 4th module: 20,000 Newbucks
    - 5th module: 100,000 Newbucks
    - Additional modules: Available with special currency from late-game content
  - **Recommendation:** Hunt Ghostly Drones (free) rather than purchasing

**Strategic Position:**

Your ranch is now a self-sustaining empire. Quantum Drones handle all routine tasks while you explore endgame biomes, hunt for rare resources, and prepare for the Grey Labyrinth. The automation infrastructure you've built will continue generating wealth 24/7 while you focus on the final challenges.

## Chapter 3: Ember Valley - Resource Extraction

**Mindset:** _Extract critical resources._

Expand your Conservatory to 8 plots while simultaneously extracting Ember Valley's resources and blueprints for Tier II upgrades.

### The Operational Blueprint

**Primary Objective:** Expand Conservatory to 8 plots while unlocking Tier II Vacpack upgrades

**Financial Checkpoint:**
- **Starting Budget:** Should have 5,000-8,000+ Newbucks from Chapter 2 operations (4 Largo corrals)
- **Required:** ~12,045 Newbucks for ranch expansion (8,745 NB) and upgrades (3,300+ NB)
- **Timeline:** Achieve in 5-7 days through all 4 Conservatory operations
- **Farming Strategy:** If short on funds, spend 2-3 days farming plorts while simultaneously harvesting Ember Valley resources (Jellystone, Deep Brine, Primordy Oil, Lava Dust, Radiant Ore) to stockpile materials for future upgrades

**Strategic Priorities:**

- Establish two new corral operations (Crystal-Rock and Boom-Batty) in Conservatory Plots 5-8
- Craft Water Tank and Dash Boots immediately (essential equipment)
- Pop all 5 Ember Valley Gordos to unlock treasure pods containing upgrade blueprints
- Harvest critical Tier II crafting materials (Jellystone, Deep Brine, Radiant Ore, Primordy Oil)
- Activate all Map Data Nodes for complete navigational awareness
- Craft Tier II upgrades (Extra Tank, Power Core II, Jetpack II)

**Key Success Metrics:**

- Conservatory expanded to 8 plots with 4 active corral operations
- Daily revenue increased from ~800 to ~2,500+ Newbucks
- All 5 Ember Valley Gordos popped, treasure pods opened
- Tier II upgrade components secured (Storage Cell, Power Chip, Heart Cell, Jetpack Drive)
- Tier II upgrades crafted: Water Tank, Dash Boots, Extra Tank, Power Core II, Jetpack II
- Resource stockpiles: 50+ Jellystone, 30+ Deep Brine, 30+ Radiant Ore, 30+ Primordy Oil

### Gordo Strategy

Pop all five Ember Valley Gordos to unlock shortcuts, treasure pods, and key blueprints:

| **Gordo** | **Food Required** | **Location** | **Reward** |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Rock Gordo** | 50 Veggies (Heart Beets count 2x) | Cave near portal entrance (on rock formation) | Geyser to Jetpack Drive treasure pod |
| **Batty Gordo** | 50 Fruit (Pomegranites count 2x) | Lowest western caves | Tunnel shortcut to another area |
| **Crystal Gordo** | 50 Veggies (Odd Onions count 2x) | Northern area near chasm | Geyser for easier traversal |
| **Boom Gordo** | 50 Meat (Briar Hens count 2x) | Western volcanic area (dais surrounded by lava pools) | Passage to Grey Labyrinth gate + Strange Diamond + Ember Valley Portal blueprint |
| **Tabby Gordo** | 50 Meat (Stony Hens count 2x) | North-most point, top of large pillar sticking out of sea | Portal shortcut to Rainbow Fields |

### Slime Locations for Ember Valley

**Ember Valley Slimes:**

| **Slime** | **Diet** | **Favorite** | **Largo?** | **Location** | **Special Notes** |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Boom** | Meat | Briar Hen | YES | Volcanic areas throughout | Explodes periodically, doesn't harm self, launches plorts |
| **Batty** | Fruit | Pomegranite | YES | Western cave systems | Nocturnal, spawns at night or in dark caves, flies |

### Asset Acquisition

Before beginning ranch expansion, gather all slimes and plorts needed for your new operations. With Tank Booster from Chapter 2, you now have 30 units per slot (4 slots = 120 total capacity).

**Phase 1: Plorts for Upgrades (deposit in Refinery)**

- Enter Ember Valley and collect:
  - 10+ Boom Plorts (for Dash Boots upgrade)
  - 10+ Rock Plorts (for Extra Tank upgrade)
- Return to ranch, deposit in Refinery

**Phase 2: Plorts for Largo Creation (keep in vac - DO NOT deposit)**

- Enter Ember Valley and collect:
  - 6 Batty Plorts (to feed Boom Slimes for Boom-Batty largos)
  - 6 Rock Plorts (to feed Crystal Slimes for Crystal-Rock largos)
- Return to ranch, keep these in your vac for creating Largos

**Phase 3: Slime Collection for Ranch Expansion**

- **6 Crystal Slimes:** Northern Ember Valley near chasm (deal contact damage, be careful)
- **6 Boom Slimes:** Volcanic areas throughout Ember Valley
- Return to ranch, deploy slimes and feed plorts to create Largos immediately

### Resource Extraction

**Ember Valley Resources:**

| **Resource** | **Location** | **Uses** |

### Upgrade Path for this Chapter (Priority Order)

| **Upgrade** | **Cost** | **Materials** | **Effect** | **Priority** |
|-------------|----------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| **Water Tank** | 450 NB | 10 Deep Brine | Specialized water vac tank | **CRAFT FIRST** - Essential Tarr safety |
| **Dash Boots** | 450 NB | 10 Boom Plort | Reduced sprint energy cost | HIGH - Mobility for Ember Valley |
| **Extra Tank** | 1,500 NB | 10 Rock Plort, 10 Silky Sand | Adds 4th vac slot | MEDIUM - Better collection capacity |
| **Power Core II** | 1,000 NB | 20 Cotton Plort, 10 Batty Plort, 10 Primordy Oil, 10 Jellystone, 1 Power Chip | 150 → 200 Energy | DELAYED - Craft after unlocking blueprints |

**Upgrade Components Required:**
- **Jetpack Drive** (Tier II blueprint) - Rock Gordo treasure pod (plateau above gordo)
- **Power Chip** (Tier II blueprint) - Batty Gordo treasure pod
- **Heart Cell** (Tier II blueprint) - Underground ledge before Crystal Gordo waterfall
- **Storage Cell** (Tier II blueprint) - Behind Rainbow Fields portal (1 Batty Plort statue)

**Total Investment:** ~3,400 NB (upgrades only) + 8,745 NB (ranch expansion) = ~12,145 NB + materials

**Material Collection Strategy:**
As you explore Ember Valley popping Gordos and opening treasure pods, prioritize harvesting:
- Jellystone (10+ for Power Core II and future upgrades)
- Primordy Oil (10+ for Power Core II)
- Deep Brine (10+ for Water Tank)
- Silky Sand (10+ for Extra Tank)
- Radiant Ore (20+ for future Jetpack II in Chapter 4)

**Save For Chapter 4:** Tank Booster II, Heart Module II, and Jetpack II will be crafted in Chapter 4 once you explore Starlight Strand and gather the necessary materials (Angler Plorts, Honey Plorts, Wild Honey).

### Treasure Pod Locations

**Priority 1 - Upgrade Components:**

- **Jetpack Drive:** Plateau above Rock Gordo (requires popping gordo + Jetpack). Essential for Jetpack II upgrade (20% energy reduction).
- **Storage Cell:** Behind Rainbow Fields portal, activate Batty Statue with 1 Batty Plort. Required for Tank Booster II.
- **Heart Cell:** Underground ledge before Crystal Gordo waterfall. Needed for Heart Module II (200 HP).
- **Vac Tank:** Top of coastal waterfall in water with Puddle Slimes. Required for Extra Tank II (5th vac slot).
- **Sureshot Module:** Underground lava fields behind Angler Plort door. Enables Golden Sureshot series for Gold Slime hunting.

**Priority 2 - Portal & Rare Materials:**

- **Ember Valley Portal + Strange Diamond:** Both in room behind Boom Gordo. Portal eliminates 5-10 minutes per farming run; Strange Diamond is 1 of only 3 available pre-Chapter 11.

### Map Data Node Locations

- **Volcano Summit (East Coverage):** At the very top of the volcano's caldera. Reveals eastern half of Ember Valley including lava fields and northern chasm.
- **Western Coast Pillar (West Coverage):** Tall rock pillar in geyser-filled western coastal area. Reveals western half including volcanic region and caves.
- **Southern Lava Plateau (South Coverage):** High rock plateau near Boom Gordo in southern lava fields. Completes map coverage of southern volcanic zones.

### Refinery Link Deployment

Once you have the Refinery Link blueprint unlocked, deploy one in Ember Valley for efficient resource collection.

- **Crafting Requirements:** 250 Newbucks + 10 Phosphor Plorts + 10 Jellystone + 5 Deep Brine
- **Optimal Placement:** Central geyser area between the Batty Gordo caves (western) and Crystal Gordo caves (northern) - this central hub provides easy access from most resource-rich zones (volcanic area, northern chasm, coastal caves)
- **Alternative Placement:** Top of volcano caldera near Map Data Node - convenient for northern resource runs but requires more jetpack travel from southern and cave areas
- **Benefit:** Eliminates need to return to Conservatory when inventory fills with Jellystone, Radiant Ore, Primordy Oil, and Lava Dust during extended farming sessions

### Portal System

Establish a complete fast-travel loop between your ranch and Ember Valley using two complementary portals.

**Phase 1: Ember Valley Portal (One-Way to Ember Valley)**

- **Blueprint Location:** Treasure pod in room behind Boom Gordo
- **Crafting Cost:** 2,000 Newbucks + 20 Boom Plorts + 10 Crystal Plorts + 10 Radiant Ore + 10 Primordy Oil
- **Placement (Conservatory-Side):** Central Conservatory area between expansion entrances

**Phase 2: Red Home Portal (One-Way to Conservatory)**

- **Crafting Cost:** 1,000 Newbucks + 20 Boom Plorts + 10 Jellystone + 10 Primordy Oil + 5 Lava Dust
- **Placement (Ember Valley-Side):** Central geyser area between Batty and Crystal Gordo cave entrances (same location as Refinery Link)
- **Why Red:** Uses Ember Valley resources (Boom Plorts, Lava Dust, Primordy Oil) you're already farming here

**Total Investment:** 3,000 Newbucks + materials

**Benefit:** Eliminates 5-10 minutes per resource farming run. Essential for efficient Primordy Oil, Radiant Ore, and Lava Dust collection throughout mid-game.

### Additional Ember Valley Tips

- Fire Slimes spawn in lava pools.
- Boom Slimes explode periodically but don't harm themselves. The explosion can launch plorts across your ranch - another reason Plort Collectors are essential.
- Crystal and Rock Slimes deal contact damage. Use the Pulse Wave (craftable in Chapter 4 once you have Flutter Plorts) to push them away, or simply keep your distance when collecting their plorts.
- Angler Slimes can stun food and other slimes with their antenna. They're best combined into Largos for easier management.
- Briar Hens (Boom slimes' favorite) and Stony Hens (Tabby slimes' favorite) spawn in Ember Valley. Stock up on these for efficient Gordo feeding.

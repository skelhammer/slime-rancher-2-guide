## Chapter 12: The Digsite - Weather Slime Operations

> **⚠️ OPTIONAL CHAPTER:** This chapter is for players who have collected Dervish and Tangle slimes from weather events. If you have not collected these slimes or do not wish to ranch them, **skip this chapter** and proceed to Chapter 13 (The Endgame Audit).

**Mindset:** _Elite weather slime integration._

Weather event slimes (Dervish and Tangle) are among the rarest in the game, spawning only during Level 3 weather events. If you've collected them, The Digsite provides the perfect home for these premium assets.

### Prerequisites

**You MUST have collected:**
- **Dervish Slimes:** Spawn during Level 3 Wind Storms (Cyclones) in all biomes
- **Tangle Slimes:** Spawn during Level 3 Pollen Storms in all biomes
- **Painted Hens:** Spawn during Level 3 Pollen Storms (same as Tangle)

**If you haven't collected these slimes:** Skip this chapter and go to Chapter 13.

### The Operational Blueprint

#### Phase 1: Unlock The Digsite

**Capital Required:** 6,000 Newbucks

The Digsite is accessed through The Den's eastern passage. This 4-plot expansion will house your weather event slimes.

**Location:** Eastern passage from The Den (look for the cave tunnel)

#### Phase 2: Plot-by-Plot Build

Execute the following build in order:

**Plot 1: Garden - Prickle Pears**
- **Cost:** 250 Newbucks
- **Purpose:** Feeds Dervish-Ringtail Largos (Plot 2), backup for Tangle-Hyper (Plot 4)
- **Upgrade:** Install Nutrient Soil (600 Newbucks) + Sprinkler (700 Newbucks)
- **Deposit:** Prickle Pear (found in Ember Valley or Grey Labyrinth)
- **Yield:** Standard garden yield (7-13 per harvest)

**Plot 2: Corral - Dervish-Ringtail Largos**
- **Cost:** 250 Newbucks (corral)
- **Slimes:** 6 Dervish-Ringtail Largos
- **Creation:** Feed 6 Dervish Slimes with Ringtail Plorts (or vice versa)
- **Upgrades:**
  - High Walls: 260 Newbucks (mandatory)
  - Music Box: 350 Newbucks (reduces tornado frequency)
  - Auto-Feeder: 750 Newbucks (set to Normal speed, stock with Prickle Pears)
  - Plort Collector: 750 Newbucks (collects Dervish + Ringtail plorts)
- **Diet:** Omnivore (Dervish eats fruit, Ringtail eats anything)
- **Food Source:** Prickle Pear (Plot 1 - Dervish favorite)
- **Plort Production:** Dervish Plorts (75 base!) + Ringtail Plorts (42-70)
- **Special:** Dervish creates tornadoes when agitated (other Dervish slimes are immune), Ringtail turns to stone in daylight
- **Revenue per Feeding:** ~150-200 Newbucks (4 plorts total with favorite food)
- **VERY HIGH VALUE COMBO**

**Plot 3: Coop - Painted Hens + Roostros**
- **Cost:** 250 Newbucks
- **Purpose:** Breeds Painted Hens for Tangle-Hyper Largos (Plot 4)
- **Upgrades:**
  - High Walls: 200 Newbucks
  - Spring Grass: 600 Newbucks (speeds chick growth)
  - Vitamizer: 700 Newbucks (increases egg production)
- **Stock:** 6-8 Painted Hens + 2 Roostros (collected during Level 3 Pollen Storms)
- **Production:** Painted Hens breed continuously

**Plot 4: Corral - Tangle-Hyper Largos**
- **Cost:** 250 Newbucks (corral)
- **Slimes:** 6 Tangle-Hyper Largos
- **Creation:** Feed 6 Tangle Slimes with Hyper Plorts (or vice versa)
- **Upgrades:**
  - High Walls: 260 Newbucks (mandatory - both slimes are very active)
  - Air Net: 425 Newbucks (CRITICAL - Hyper component is extremely bouncy)
  - Music Box: 350 Newbucks (reduces agitation)
  - Auto-Feeder: 750 Newbucks (set to Normal speed, stock with Painted Hens)
  - Plort Collector: 750 Newbucks (collects Tangle + Hyper plorts)
- **Diet:** Omnivore (Tangle eats meat, Hyper eats veggies)
- **Food Source:** Painted Hen (Plot 3 - Tangle favorite) OR Prickle Pear (Plot 1) as backup
- **Plort Production:** Tangle Plorts + Hyper Plorts
- **Special:** Tangle vines grab food from 10 units away, Hyper is extremely fast and bouncy
- **Revenue per Feeding:** ~120-200 Newbucks (4 plorts total with favorite food)
- **MAXIMUM SECURITY REQUIRED - This is the most difficult largo to contain in the game**

#### Phase 3: Automation Integration

**Auto-Feeder Setup:**
- Plot 2 (Dervish-Ringtail): Stock with Prickle Pears, set to Normal speed
- Plot 4 (Tangle-Hyper): Stock with Painted Hens (or Prickle Pears as backup), set to Normal speed

**Plort Collector Management:**
- Both corrals have Plort Collectors that auto-vacuum plorts
- Manually collect and deposit to nearby Silo (The Archway Plot 5 or other expansions)
- **OR** set up Quantum Drone to transport plorts

**Food Restocking:**
- Plot 1 (Prickle Pear Garden): Harvest every 2-3 in-game days, restock Auto-Feeders
- Plot 3 (Painted Hen Coop): Collect hens as needed, restock Plot 4 Auto-Feeder

### Strategic Priorities

1. **Air Net on Tangle-Hyper Corral is MANDATORY**: The Hyper component makes this the most difficult largo to contain. Without Air Net, they WILL escape.
2. **Music Box on Both Corrals**: Dervish creates tornadoes, Hyper dashes constantly. Music Box reduces these behaviors.
3. **Monitor Tangle Vines**: Tangle vines can grab food from outside the corral (10 unit range). Keep neighboring plots clear or they'll steal food.
4. **This Chapter is Optional**: If you find weather slimes too difficult to manage, skip this expansion entirely.

### Financial Checkpoint

**Total Capital Required:**
- Expansion: 6,000 Newbucks
- Plots: 1,000 Newbucks (4 plots: 250 + 250 + 250 + 250)
- Upgrades: ~7,450 Newbucks (gardens, corrals, coop upgrades)
- **Total: ~14,450 Newbucks**

**Revenue Added:**
- Dervish-Ringtail Largos: ~150-200 Newbucks per feeding × 6 slimes = 900-1,200/day
- Tangle-Hyper Largos: ~120-200 Newbucks per feeding × 6 slimes = 720-1,200/day
- **Total Digsite Revenue: +2,500-3,500 Newbucks/day (if built)**

**Total Ranch Revenue (after Chapter 12):**
- Previous Ranch Revenue (Ch 11): ~8,500-12,000 Newbucks/day
- Digsite Addition: +2,500-3,500 Newbucks/day
- **New Total: ~11,000-15,500+ Newbucks/day**

### Success Metrics

By the end of Chapter 12, you should have:
- ✅ The Digsite expansion unlocked and operational (OR intentionally skipped)
- ✅ Dervish-Ringtail Largos established in Plot 2 (if built)
- ✅ Tangle-Hyper Largos established in Plot 4 (if built)
- ✅ Auto-Feeders installed and stocked on both corrals (if built)
- ✅ Painted Hen breeding operation in Plot 3 (if built)
- ✅ Prickle Pear garden producing in Plot 1 (if built)
- ✅ Weather event slimes fully integrated OR chapter skipped

### Next Chapter Preparation

Chapter 13 (The Endgame Audit) requires significant Grey Labyrinth plort stockpiles. Begin systematically farming Shadow Plorts (1,185 total needed) and Prisma Plorts (245 total needed) if you haven't already.

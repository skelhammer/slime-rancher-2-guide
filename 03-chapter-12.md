## Chapter 12: The Digsite - Weather Slime Operations

> **⚠️ OPTIONAL CHAPTER:** This chapter is for players who have collected Dervish and Tangle slimes from weather events. If you have not collected these slimes or do not wish to ranch them, **skip this chapter** and proceed to Chapter 13 (The Endgame Audit).

**Mindset:** _Elite weather slime integration._

Weather event slimes (Dervish and Tangle) are among the rarest in the game, spawning only during Level 3 weather events. If you've collected them, The Digsite provides the perfect home for these premium assets.

### Prerequisites

**You MUST have collected:**
- **Dervish Slimes:** Spawn during Level 3 Wind Storms (Cyclones) in all biomes
- **Tangle Slimes:** Spawn during Level 3 Pollen Storms in all biomes
- **Painted Hens:** Spawn during Level 3 Pollen Storms (same as Tangle)

**If you haven't collected these slimes:** Skip this chapter and go to Chapter 13.

### The Operational Blueprint

**Primary Objective:** Integrate rare weather event slimes into automated ranch operations (optional)

**Financial Checkpoint:**
- **Starting Budget:** Should have 50,000-60,000+ Newbucks from Chapter 11 operations
- **Required:** ~14,450 Newbucks for Digsite unlock (6,000 NB) and build-out (8,445 NB)
- **Daily Revenue:** ~8,500-12,000 Newbucks from all operations
- **Timeline:** Achieve in 2-3 days if you have weather slimes ready
- **Farming Strategy:** If you lack weather slimes, this chapter is skippable. Focus on Shadow/Prisma Plort farming for Chapter 13 instead.

**Strategic Priorities:**

- Unlock The Digsite expansion (6,000 Newbucks - accessed via The Den eastern passage)
- Establish two weather event largo operations (Dervish-Ringtail and Tangle-Hyper)
- Deploy maximum security measures (Air Net on Tangle-Hyper is MANDATORY)
- Integrate rare weather slimes into automated ranch systems

**Key Success Metrics:**

- The Digsite unlocked and fully developed (4 plots) - OR chapter skipped
- Weather event slimes integrated into automation - OR skipped
- Total ranch revenue increased to 11,000-15,500+ Newbucks/day - IF built
- All Auto-Feeders operational to prevent rare slime starvation

**Capital Requirements:**

- Digsite Unlock: 6,000 Newbucks
- Full Build-Out: ~8,445 Newbucks (2 corrals + 1 coop + 1 garden)
- **Total Investment: ~14,445 Newbucks**
- Recommended Starting Budget: 15,000+ Newbucks

#### Phase 1: Unlock The Digsite

**Capital Required:** 6,000 Newbucks

The Digsite is accessed through The Den's eastern passage. This 4-plot expansion will house your weather event slimes.

**Location:** Eastern passage from The Den (look for the cave tunnel)

**Layout:** Archaeological dig site with exposed ruins and artifacts. Open-air environment suitable for all slime types.

#### Phase 2: Plot-by-Plot Build

Execute the following build in order:

**The Digsite (4 plots - NEW EXPANSION - OPTIONAL):**

| **Plot** | **Type** | **Contents** | **Base Cost** | **Upgrades** | **Total Cost** | **Purpose/Notes** |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **1** | Garden | Prickle Pears | 250 NB | Nutrient Soil (600), Sprinkler (700) | 1,550 NB | Feeds Plot 2 (Dervish favorite), backup for Plot 4. From Ember Valley or Grey Labyrinth. 7-13 per harvest |
| **2** | Corral | Dervish-Ringtail Largos (6) | 250 NB | High Walls (260), Music Box (350), Auto-Feeder (750), Plort Collector (750) | 2,360 NB | Produces Dervish + Ringtail Plorts. Feed Prickle Pears (Dervish favorite, 4 plorts/feeding). Revenue: ~150-200 NB/feeding. **VERY HIGH VALUE COMBO**. Dervish creates tornadoes (Music Box reduces), Ringtail turns to stone in daylight |
| **3** | Coop | Painted Hens + Roostros | 250 NB | High Walls (200), Spring Grass (600), Vitamizer (700) | 1,750 NB | Feeds Plot 4. Stock: 6-8 hens + 2 roostros (from Level 3 Pollen Storms). Breeds continuously |
| **4** | Corral | Tangle-Hyper Largos (6) | 250 NB | High Walls (260), Air Net (425), Music Box (350), Auto-Feeder (750), Plort Collector (750) | 2,785 NB | Produces Tangle + Hyper Plorts. Feed Painted Hens (Tangle favorite, 4 plorts/feeding). Revenue: ~120-200 NB/feeding. **MAXIMUM SECURITY REQUIRED** - Air Net CRITICAL (Hyper extremely bouncy). Tangle vines grab food from 10 units away |

**Total Investment:** 6,000 NB (expansion) + 8,445 NB (plots/upgrades) = 14,445 NB

#### Phase 3: Key Notes

**Auto-Feeder Setup:**
- Plot 2 (Dervish-Ringtail): Prickle Pears | Plot 4 (Tangle-Hyper): Painted Hens

**CRITICAL - Tangle-Hyper Security:**
- Air Net is MANDATORY (Hyper extremely bouncy - WILL escape without it)
- Tangle vines grab food from 10 units away (keep neighboring plots clear)
- Music Box on both corrals (Dervish tornadoes, Hyper dashing)

#### Phase 4: Infrastructure Gadgets (Optional Quality-of-Life)

**Market Link Placement:**
- **Location:** Central area of The Digsite near Plots 2 and 4 (corrals)
- **Cost:** 250 NB + 20 Pink Plorts + 10 Buzz Wax + 10 Primordy Oil + 5 Silky Sand
- **Purpose:** Quickly sell Dervish, Ringtail, Tangle, and Hyper plorts without traveling through Den to Conservatory
- **Usage:** Sell all weather event plorts here (no plorts need stockpiling)

**Refinery Link Placement:**
- **Location:** Near entrance from The Den
- **Cost:** 250 NB + 10 Phosphor Plorts + 10 Jellystone + 5 Deep Brine
- **Purpose:** Convenient deposit point for resources collected during exploration or occasional spawns
- **Note:** The Digsite primarily houses rare slimes, not a major exploration resource zone

**Dash Pad Placement:**
- **Location:** Path between The Den entrance and The Digsite entrance
- **Cost:** 500 NB + 10 Crystal Plorts + 10 Angler Plorts + 5 Lava Dust + 5 Silky Sand
- **Purpose:** Sprint with zero energy cost between Den and Digsite

### End of Chapter Completion Checklist

**IMPORTANT:** This chapter is optional. If you haven't collected weather slimes or find them too difficult to manage, skip this expansion entirely and proceed to Chapter 13.

**If you completed this chapter, verify:

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pink | Omnivore | None | All Biomes | Yes | The most common slime; will eat anything. |
| Cotton | Veggies | Water Lettuce | Rainbow Fields | Yes | A natural high jumper that requires High Walls. |

| Crystal | Veggies | Odd Onion | Ember Valley | Yes | Deals contact damage to the player from its sharp crystals. |
| Honey | Fruit | Mint Mango | Starlight Strand, Grey Labyrinth (Prismacore during boss fight) | Yes | Its plorts are extra sweet, attracting other slimes from larger distances than normal plorts. Increases risk of unwanted Largos/Tarr - use High Walls and Air Net. |
| Hunter | Meat | Roostro | Starlight Strand | Yes | Can turn invisible, making it hard to see. Can also create a feral-like state in other slimes. |
| Angler | Meat | Sea Hen | Starlight Strand, Tidepools | Yes | Uses its glowing lure to stun chickens and other small slimes before eating. |
| Ringtail | Omnivore | None | Starlight Strand | Yes | Turns to stone in daylight. Becomes ravenous at night and will eat until it can't anymore. |

| Saber | Meat | Thundercluck | Powderfall Bluffs | Yes | Aggressive and territorial. Can launch a stunning roar that startles other slimes. |
| Fire | Ash | Ash | Ember Valley (Lava) | No  | Lives exclusively in ash-producing incinerators or on lava. Immune to fire. |
| Puddle | Water | Water | All Biomes (Water) | No  | Lives exclusively in ponds. Becomes shy and stops producing plorts if more than 4 are together. |
| Shadow | None | N/A | Grey Labyrinth (dark corners) | No  | Cannot be vacuumed up. Cannot be eaten by Tarr. Spawns in groups of 2-5. Produces plorts when hit by any thrown object (item is not consumed and can be reused). Sits motionless when undisturbed, jumps erratically when disturbed, then vanishes after a few seconds. Will despawn if left alone for several minutes. |
| Twin | Fruit | Polaricherry | Grey Labyrinth (Impossible Sky) | Yes | Shifts between cerulean blue and pink colors. Creates portal openings to pull distant food and plorts to themselves (similar to Tangle vines). Other items can get sucked in as well. |
| Sloomber | Meat | Candied Hen | Grey Labyrinth (Dream Land) | Yes | Occasionally releases puffs of clouds that put nearby slimes to sleep. When agitated, this behavior becomes far more frequent. Pastel magenta/blue with sparkling clouds on lower half. |
| Hyper | Veggies | Turbo Tater | Grey Labyrinth (Terrarium) | Yes | Can make short-distance dashes, dashes more often when agitated. Extremely fast and bounces wildly off walls; requires a Music Box and Air Net to reliably contain. |
| Prisma | Special | Prisma Plorts | Grey Labyrinth | No  | A temporary slime formed from unstable resources during Prisma Disruptions. Cannot be ranched. |
| Dervish | Fruit | Prickle Pear | During Level 3 Wind Storms | Yes | Rides atop cyclones at high speed. When agitated, creates large independent tornadoes that sweep up food, slimes, and plorts. Other Dervish slimes are immune to these tornadoes. |
| Tangle | Meat | Painted Hen | During Level 3 Pollen Storms | Yes | Uses vines (up to 10 units range) to grab food and plorts from outside its corral. When happy, grows buds filled with food that can be cracked open. Can occasionally tunnel out of pens. |
| Yolky | None | N/A | Near Chicken Nests (All Biomes) | No  | Must be placed inside a coop with adult hens. Causes nearby Hen Hens to occasionally lay Giant Eggs containing 5 Chickadoos and 5 Yolky Plorts (if fresh - glowing yolk, spoils after 3 in-game hours). Does not eat food. |
| Gold | Special | None | All Biomes (Rare) | No  | Extremely fast and rare. Produces sparkle sound when nearby. Flees from player and despawns quickly. Drops 1-4 Gold Plorts when hit with any item (amount depends on Golden Sureshot upgrade level). Cannot be vacuumed or stored. |
| Lucky | Meat | None | All Biomes (Rare) | No  | Produces jingling sound when nearby. Becomes stationary when it detects player. Awards 100-150 Newbucks on first feed, 200-300 on second, 300 on third+. Despawns after eating. Does not produce plorts. Cannot be vacuumed or stored. |
| Tarr | Slimes | Other Slimes | From failed largos | No  | Hostile to the player and eats other slimes to replicate. Weak to fresh water. |

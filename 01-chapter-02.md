## Chapter 2: The Conservatory - Foundation Build

**Mindset:** _Expand and diversify operations._

### The Operational Blueprint

**Primary Objective:** Expand from 2 plots to 4 plots with essential crafting plort production

**Financial Checkpoint:**
- **Starting Budget:** Should have 500-1,000+ Newbucks from Chapter 1 operations
- **Required:** ~4,500 Newbucks for Phosphor-Honey operation (3,660 NB) and upgrades (900 NB)
- **Timeline:** Achieve in 5-7 days through continued Tabby-Cotton sales
- **Farming Strategy:** If short on funds, spend 2-3 days farming plorts from existing operations while simultaneously harvesting resources (Jellystone, Deep Brine, Radiant Ore) in Ember Valley to stockpile materials for Chapter 3

**Strategic Priorities:**

- Unlock Starlight Strand by popping Cotton Gordo
- Capture Honey and Phosphor Slimes for new Phosphor-Honey operation
- Establish Phosphor-Honey crafting operation while keeping Tabby-Cotton running
- Craft Tier I upgrades (Power Core, Tank Booster)
- Stockpile crafting plorts (Phosphor, Honey, Cotton) for Chapter 3 upgrades

**Key Success Metrics:**

- Conservatory expanded to 4 plots (Tabby-Cotton + Phosphor-Honey operations)
- Daily revenue maintained at ~800-1,000 Newbucks
- Tier I upgrades crafted (Power Core, Tank Booster)
- Starlight Strand unlocked and accessible

### Gordo Strategy

**Cotton Gordo:**
- **Location:** Rainbow Fields - SE of Refinery Link, top of hill
- **Food:** Vegetables (30 total, or 15 Water Lettuce)
- **Reward:** Cave to Starlight Strand portal switch

**Phosphor Gordo:**
- **Location:** Rainbow Fields - Cave near south Conservatory exit
- **Food:** Fruit (30 total, or 15 Cuberries)
- **Reward:** Treasure pod access with blueprints

### Slime Locations for Chapter 2

**Starlight Strand (needed for this chapter):**

- **Honey Slimes:** Found near flowery areas in the pink biome
- **Phosphor Slimes:** Spawn at night throughout Rainbow Island and Starlight Strand

### Asset Collection Sequence

**Phase 1: Unlock Starlight Strand**

- Pop Cotton Gordo to activate portal (feed 15 Water Lettuce from your garden)

**Phase 2: Starlight Strand Collection**

- Enter Starlight Strand and collect:
  - 6 Phosphor Slimes (for Phosphor-Honey largos)
  - 6 Honey Plorts (from wild Honey Slimes - to convert Phosphor into Largos)
  - 30+ Cuberries (for feeding Phosphor-Honey largos)
- Return to ranch and deploy slimes immediately

### Ranch Development & Plot Allocation (Conservatory - 4 plots)

Now that you have all necessary slimes, execute the expansion:

**Starter Operation (Plots 1 & 2) - KEEP RUNNING:**

**Plot 1 (Corral):** Tabby-Cotton Largo Division (6 slimes) - UNCHANGED from Chapter 1

**Plot 2 (Garden):** Water Lettuce - UNCHANGED from Chapter 1

**Crafting Component Operation (Plots 3 & 4) - NEW:**

**Plot 3 (Corral):** Phosphor-Honey Largo Division (6 slimes).

- **Build Order:** Corral (250) → High Walls (260) → Air Net (425) → Solar Shield (425) → Plort Collector (750)
- **Total Investment:** 2,110 Newbucks
- **Feed Strategy:** Cuberries (Phosphor favorite food, produces 2 Phosphor + 2 Honey plorts per feeding)

**Plot 4 (Garden):** Cuberry garden for Phosphor-Honey Largos.

- **Build Order:** Garden (250) → Nutrient Soil (600) → Sprinkler (700)
- **Total Investment:** 1,550 Newbucks
- **Crop:** Cuberry (Phosphor favorite food)

**Plots 5-8:** EMPTY - Reserved for Chapter 3 expansion

These plots will be developed in Chapter 3 with Hunter-Rock and Boom-Batty operations once you have more capital and upgrade components from Ember Valley.

### Upgrade Path for this Chapter (Priority Order)

- **Power Core** (450 Newbucks + 10 Cotton Plorts): Boosts energy to 150. Your Tabby-Cotton operation provides abundant Cotton Plorts for this upgrade.
- **Tank Booster** (450 Newbucks + 10 Tabby Plorts): Increases carrying capacity from 20 to 30 units per slot. This is a massive quality-of-life improvement for Chapter 3 collection runs.
- **Plot Upgrades:** Plort Collector (750 Newbucks) and essential corral upgrades (High Walls, Air Net, Solar Shield) for your Phosphor-Honey operation.

**Total Investment:** 900 Newbucks + materials

### Additional Tips

- Phosphor-Honey Largos are essential for crafting plort accumulation. Deposit Phosphor and Honey Plorts into Refinery for reserves. Sell excess once you have 50+ of each type stockpiled.
- Cuberries are Phosphor slimes' favorite food, producing 2 Phosphor + 2 Honey plorts per feeding (4 total).
- With 4 inventory slots at 20 units each (80 total capacity), focus on one task at a time: collect slimes, return to ranch, then collect food.

### End of Chapter Completion Checklist

- **Gordo Target:** Cotton Gordo popped, granting access to Starlight Strand ✓
- **Asset Upgrade:** Tabby-Cotton Largos kept running while adding Phosphor-Honey crafting operation ✓
- **Ranch Expansion:** Conservatory expanded to 4 plots with:
  - Tabby-Cotton Largo corral (from Chapter 1) producing Tabby and Cotton plorts ✓
  - Phosphor-Honey Largo corral producing essential crafting plorts ✓
  - Two fully upgraded gardens for Water Lettuce and Cuberries ✓
  - Plots 5-8 reserved for Chapter 3 expansion ✓
- **Daily Revenue:** Maintained at ~800-1,000 Newbucks (focus on crafting stockpile, not revenue) ✓
- **Upgrades:** Power Core and Tank Booster crafted ✓

### Next Chapter Preparation

Chapter 3 expands the Conservatory to 8 plots and focuses on Ember Valley resource extraction while crafting Tier II upgrades.

- **Financial Goal:** Save at least 10,000 Newbucks for ranch expansion (8,745 NB) and upgrades (Water Tank, Dash Boots, Extra Tank).
- **Asset Collection:** Chapter 3 begins with collection runs to gather Boom, Batty, Crystal, and Rock slimes and wild plorts from Ember Valley.
- **Gordo Preparation:** Stockpile vegetables (Heart Beets for Rock Gordo), fruit (Pomegranites for Batty Gordo), and meat (Briar Hens for Boom Gordo, Stony Hens for Tabby Gordo).
- **Tank Booster Advantage:** With 30 units per slot (up from 20), you'll have much better capacity for Chapter 3's extensive collection runs.

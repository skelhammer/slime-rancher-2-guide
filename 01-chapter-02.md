## Chapter 2: The Conservatory - Foundation Build

**Mindset:** _Expand and diversify operations._

### The Operational Blueprint

**Primary Objective:** Expand from 2 plots to 4 plots with essential crafting plort production

**Financial Checkpoint:**
- **Starting Budget:** Should have 500-1,000+ Newbucks from Chapter 1 operations
- **Required:** ~4,500 Newbucks for Phosphor-Honey operation (3,660 NB) and upgrades (900 NB)
- **Timeline:** Achieve in 5-7 days through continued Tabby-Cotton sales
- **Farming Strategy:** If short on funds, spend 2-3 days farming plorts from existing operations while simultaneously harvesting resources (Jellystone, Deep Brine, Radiant Ore) in Ember Valley to stockpile materials for Chapter 3

**Strategic Priorities:**

- Unlock Starlight Strand by popping Cotton Gordo
- Capture Honey and Phosphor Slimes for new Phosphor-Honey operation
- Establish Phosphor-Honey crafting operation while keeping Tabby-Cotton running
- Craft Tier I upgrades (Power Core, Tank Booster)
- Stockpile crafting plorts (Phosphor, Honey, Cotton) for Chapter 3 upgrades

**Key Success Metrics:**

- Conservatory expanded to 4 plots (Tabby-Cotton + Phosphor-Honey operations)
- Daily revenue maintained at ~800-1,000 Newbucks
- Tier I upgrades crafted (Power Core, Tank Booster)
- Starlight Strand unlocked and accessible

### Gordo Strategy

Pop these two Rainbow Fields Gordos to unlock Starlight Strand access and treasure pods:

| **Gordo** | **Food Required** | **Location** | **Reward** |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Cotton Gordo** | 30 Veggies (Water Lettuce counts 2x) | Rainbow Fields - SE of Refinery Link, top of hill | Cave to Starlight Strand portal switch |
| **Phosphor Gordo** | 30 Fruit (Cuberries counts 2x) | Rainbow Fields - Cave near south Conservatory exit | Treasure pod access with blueprints |

### Slime Locations for Chapter 2

**Starlight Strand Slimes (needed for this chapter):**

| **Slime** | **Diet** | **Favorite** | **Largo?** | **Location** | **Special Notes** |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Honey** | Fruit | Mint Mango | YES | Flowery areas in pink biome | Docile, honey plorts attract other slimes |
| **Phosphor** | Fruit | Cuberry | YES | Throughout (NIGHT ONLY) | Glowing, requires Solar Shield in corrals, burns in sunlight |

#### Phase 1: Unlock Starlight Strand

Pop the Cotton Gordo to activate the portal to Starlight Strand.

- **Cotton Gordo Location:** Rainbow Fields - Southeast of Refinery Link, top of hill
- **Food Required:** 30 Veggies (Water Lettuce counts 2x, so 15 Water Lettuce)
- **Reward:** Cave access to Starlight Strand portal switch

#### Phase 2: Asset Acquisition & Preparation

Enter Starlight Strand and collect the necessary slimes and resources.

**Slimes Needed:**
- 6 Phosphor Slimes (spawn at NIGHT only throughout Starlight Strand)
- 6 Honey Plorts (from wild Honey Slimes in flowery pink areas)

**Food Stockpile:**
- 30+ Cuberries (Phosphor favorite - found throughout Starlight Strand)

**Collection Strategy:**
- Wait for nighttime to capture Phosphor Slimes (they burn in daylight)
- Collect Honey Plorts from wild Honey Slimes during the day
- Harvest Cuberries to stockpile for initial feeding
- Return to ranch and deploy slimes immediately

#### Phase 3: Plot-by-Plot Build

Execute the following Conservatory expansion:

| **Plot** | **Type** | **Contents** | **Base Cost** | **Upgrades** | **Total Cost** | **Purpose/Notes** |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **1** | Corral | Tabby-Cotton Largos (6) | - | - | 935 NB | UNCHANGED from Chapter 1 - keep running |
| **2** | Garden | Water Lettuce | - | - | 250 NB | UNCHANGED from Chapter 1 - feeds Plot 1 |
| **3** | Corral | Phosphor-Honey Largos (6) | 250 NB | High Walls (260), Air Net (425), Solar Shield (425), Plort Collector (750) | 2,110 NB | **NEW** - Produces Phosphor + Honey Plorts for crafting. Feed Cuberries (Phosphor favorite, 4 plorts/feeding) |
| **4** | Garden | Cuberries | 250 NB | Nutrient Soil (600), Sprinkler (700) | 1,550 NB | **NEW** - Feeds Plot 3 |
| **5-8** | EMPTY | - | - | - | - | Reserved for Chapter 3 expansion (Crystal-Rock and Boom-Batty operations) |

**Total Investment:** 4,500 NB (plots/upgrades)

#### Phase 4: Automation Integration

**Plort Collector Management:**
- Plot 1 (Tabby-Cotton): Manually collect plorts from storage
- Plot 3 (Phosphor-Honey): Plort Collector auto-vacuums plorts
- **Crafting Plorts:** Deposit Phosphor and Honey Plorts into Refinery for reserves (target: 50+ of each)
- **Sell Excess:** Once stockpiled 50+ of each type, sell surplus

**Food Restocking:**
- Plot 2 (Water Lettuce Garden): Harvest every 2-3 in-game days, manually feed Plot 1
- Plot 4 (Cuberry Garden): Harvest every 2-3 in-game days, manually feed Plot 3
- Cuberries are Phosphor favorite (produces 4 plorts per feeding: 2 Phosphor + 2 Honey)

**Management Notes:**
- Auto-Feeders not yet available (unlock in later chapters)
- Manual feeding required every 1-2 days
- Focus on stockpiling crafting plorts, not maximizing revenue

#### Phase 5: Vacpack Upgrades (Priority Order)

- **Power Core** (450 Newbucks + 10 Cotton Plorts): Boosts energy to 150. Your Tabby-Cotton operation provides abundant Cotton Plorts for this upgrade.
- **Tank Booster** (450 Newbucks + 10 Tabby Plorts): Increases carrying capacity from 20 to 30 units per slot. This is a massive quality-of-life improvement for Chapter 3 collection runs.
- **Plot Upgrades:** Plort Collector (750 Newbucks) and essential corral upgrades (High Walls, Air Net, Solar Shield) for your Phosphor-Honey operation.

**Total Investment:** 900 Newbucks + materials

### End of Chapter Completion Checklist

### Next Chapter Preparation

Chapter 3 expands the Conservatory to 8 plots and focuses on Ember Valley resource extraction while crafting Tier II upgrades.

- **Financial Goal:** Save at least 10,000 Newbucks for ranch expansion (8,745 NB) and upgrades (Water Tank, Dash Boots, Extra Tank).
- **Asset Collection:** Chapter 3 begins with collection runs to gather Boom, Batty, Crystal, and Rock slimes and wild plorts from Ember Valley.
- **Gordo Preparation:** Stockpile vegetables (Heart Beets for Rock Gordo), fruit (Pomegranites for Batty Gordo), and meat (Briar Hens for Boom Gordo, Stony Hens for Tabby Gordo).
- **Tank Booster Advantage:** With 30 units per slot (up from 20), you'll have much better capacity for Chapter 3's extensive collection runs.

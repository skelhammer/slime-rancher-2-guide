## Chapter 2: The Conservatory - Foundation Build

**Mindset:** _Expand and diversify operations._

### The Operational Blueprint

**Primary Objective:** Expand from 2 plots to 4 plots with essential crafting plort production

**Financial Checkpoint:**
- **Starting Budget:** Should have 500-1,000+ Newbucks from Chapter 1 operations
- **Required:** ~4,500 Newbucks for Phosphor-Honey operation (3,660 NB) and upgrades (900 NB)
- **Timeline:** Achieve in 5-7 days through continued Tabby-Cotton sales
- **Farming Strategy:** If short on funds, spend 2-3 days farming plorts from existing operations while simultaneously harvesting resources (Jellystone, Deep Brine, Radiant Ore) in Ember Valley to stockpile materials for Chapter 3

**Strategic Priorities:**

- Unlock Starlight Strand by popping Cotton Gordo
- Capture Honey and Phosphor Slimes for new Phosphor-Honey operation
- Establish Phosphor-Honey crafting operation while keeping Tabby-Cotton running
- Craft Tier I upgrades (Power Core, Tank Booster)
- Stockpile crafting plorts (Phosphor, Honey, Cotton) for Chapter 3 upgrades

**Key Success Metrics:**

- Conservatory expanded to 4 plots (Tabby-Cotton + Phosphor-Honey operations)
- Daily revenue maintained at ~800-1,000 Newbucks
- Tier I upgrades crafted (Power Core, Tank Booster)
- Starlight Strand unlocked and accessible

### Gordo Strategy

Pop these two Rainbow Fields Gordos to unlock Starlight Strand access and treasure pods:

| **Gordo** | **Food Required** | **Location** | **Reward** |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Cotton Gordo** | 30 Veggies (Water Lettuce counts 2x) | Rainbow Fields - SE of Refinery Link, top of hill | Cave to Starlight Strand portal switch + 12 Cotton Slimes + 1 jar |
| **Phosphor Gordo** | 30 Fruit (Cuberries counts 2x) | Rainbow Fields - Cave near south Conservatory exit | Treasure pod access with blueprints + 12 Phosphor Slimes + 1 jar |

### Slime Locations for Chapter 2

**Starlight Strand Slimes (needed for this chapter):**

| **Slime** | **Diet** | **Favorite** | **Largo?** | **Location** | **Special Notes** |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Honey** | Fruit | Mint Mango | YES | Flowery areas in pink biome | Docile, honey plorts attract other slimes |
| **Phosphor** | Fruit | Cuberry | YES | Throughout (NIGHT ONLY) | Glowing, requires Solar Shield in corrals, burns in sunlight |

#### Phase 1: Unlock Starlight Strand

**Objective:** Pop Cotton Gordo to activate the portal to Starlight Strand.

Pop the Cotton Gordo to activate the portal to Starlight Strand (see Gordo Strategy table above for details).

#### Phase 2: Asset Acquisition & Preparation

**Objective:** Enter Starlight Strand and collect slimes/resources for Phosphor-Honey operation.

**Slimes Needed:**
- 6 Phosphor Slimes (spawn at NIGHT only throughout Starlight Strand)
- 6 Honey Plorts (from wild Honey Slimes in flowery pink areas)

**Food Stockpile:**
- 30+ Cuberries (Phosphor favorite - found throughout Starlight Strand)

**Collection Strategy:**
- Wait for nighttime to capture Phosphor Slimes (they burn in daylight)
- Collect Honey Plorts from wild Honey Slimes during the day
- Harvest Cuberries to stockpile for initial feeding
- Return to ranch and deploy slimes immediately

#### Phase 3: Plot-by-Plot Build

**Objective:** Expand Conservatory from 2 plots to 4 plots with Phosphor-Honey operation.

| **Plot** | **Type** | **Contents** | **Base Cost** | **Upgrades** | **Total Cost** | **Purpose/Notes** |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **1** | Corral | Tabby-Cotton Largos (6) | - | - | 935 NB | UNCHANGED from Chapter 1 - keep running |
| **2** | Garden | Water Lettuce | - | - | 250 NB | UNCHANGED from Chapter 1 - feeds Plot 1 |
| **3** | Corral | Phosphor-Honey Largos (6) | 250 NB | High Walls (260), Air Net (425), Solar Shield (425), Plort Collector (750) | 2,110 NB | **NEW** - Produces Phosphor + Honey Plorts for crafting. Feed Cuberries (Phosphor favorite, 4 plorts/feeding) |
| **4** | Garden | Cuberries | 250 NB | Nutrient Soil (600), Sprinkler (700) | 1,550 NB | **NEW** - Feeds Plot 3 |
| **5-8** | EMPTY | - | - | - | - | Reserved for Chapter 3 expansion (Crystal-Rock and Boom-Batty operations) |

**Total Investment:** 4,500 NB (plots/upgrades)

#### Phase 4: Key Notes

**Objective:** Manage plort stockpiling for future crafting needs.

**Plort Management:**
- Deposit Phosphor and Honey Plorts into Refinery (target: 50+ each for future upgrades)
- Sell excess after stockpiling

**Manual Feeding Required:**
- Cuberries are Phosphor favorite (4 plorts per feeding)

#### Phase 5: Vacpack Upgrades

**Objective:** Craft Tier I upgrades for improved exploration and collection capacity.

| **Upgrade** | **Cost** | **Materials** | **Effect** | **Priority** |
|-------------|----------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| **Power Core** | 450 NB | 10 Cotton Plort | 100 → 150 Energy | HIGH - Enables longer exploration |
| **Tank Booster** | 450 NB | 10 Tabby Plort | 20 → 30 units per slot | **CRITICAL** - Massive QoL for Chapter 3 collection runs |

**Total Investment:** 900 NB + materials

**Crafting Materials Source:**
- Cotton Plorts: From your Tabby-Cotton Largos (Plot 1)
- Tabby Plorts: From your Tabby-Cotton Largos (Plot 1)

### Strategic Priorities

1. **Pop Cotton Gordo:** Unlock Starlight Strand access for Honey and Phosphor collection.
2. **Night Hunt in Starlight Strand:** Capture 6 Phosphor Slimes (night only) and 6 Honey Plorts.
3. **Expand to 4 Plots:** Add Phosphor-Honey operation for essential crafting plorts.
4. **Stockpile Crafting Plorts:** Deposit 50+ Phosphor and 50+ Honey Plorts in Refinery for Chapter 3.
5. **Craft Tank Booster:** CRITICAL—increases capacity from 20 to 30 units per slot (massive QoL).
6. **Craft Power Core:** Extends exploration energy from 100 to 150.
7. **Install Auto-Feeders:** Automate feeding for Phosphor-Honey corral to maximize plort production.

### Financial Checkpoint

**Capital Required:**
- Ranch Expansion: 3,660 Newbucks (Plot 3 Corral + Plot 4 Garden + upgrades)
- Vacpack Upgrades: 900 Newbucks (Power Core, Tank Booster)
- Materials: Cotton Plorts, Tabby Plorts (from Chapter 1 operations)
- **Total: ~4,560 Newbucks**

**Revenue Impact:**

- **Starting:** ~300-500 Newbucks/day (Chapter 1: Tabby-Cotton only)
- **After Expansion:** ~800-1,000 Newbucks/day (Chapter 2: Tabby-Cotton + Phosphor-Honey)
- **Daily Increase:** +500 Newbucks/day

**Timeline to Goal:** 9-15 days to accumulate 4,560 Newbucks from Chapter 1 operations alone

**Strategic Note:** Tank Booster is transformative—30 units per slot (vs 20) means 120 total capacity (vs 80), making Chapter 3's collection runs dramatically more efficient.

### End of Chapter Checklist

By the end of Chapter 2, you should have:
- ✅ Cotton Gordo popped, granting access to Starlight Strand
- ✅ Conservatory expanded to 4 plots
- ✅ Tabby-Cotton Largo corral (from Chapter 1) still producing Tabby and Cotton plorts
- ✅ Phosphor-Honey Largo corral producing essential crafting plorts
- ✅ Two fully upgraded gardens (Water Lettuce and Cuberries)
- ✅ Plots 5-8 reserved for Chapter 3 expansion
- ✅ Daily revenue maintained at ~800-1,000 Newbucks
- ✅ Power Core and Tank Booster crafted

### Next Chapter Preparation

Chapter 3 expands the Conservatory to 8 plots and focuses on Ember Valley resource extraction while crafting Tier II upgrades.

- **Financial Goal:** Save at least 10,000 Newbucks for ranch expansion (8,745 NB) and upgrades (Water Tank, Dash Boots, Extra Tank).
- **Asset Collection:** Chapter 3 begins with collection runs to gather Boom, Batty, Crystal, and Rock slimes and wild plorts from Ember Valley.
- **Gordo Preparation:** Stockpile vegetables (Heart Beets for Rock Gordo), fruit (Pomegranites for Batty Gordo), and meat (Briar Hens for Boom Gordo, Stony Hens for Tabby Gordo).
- **Tank Booster Advantage:** With 30 units per slot (up from 20), you'll have much better capacity for Chapter 3's extensive collection runs.

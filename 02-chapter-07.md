## Chapter 7: Powderfall Bluffs - Saber Acquisition

**Mindset:** _Execute the Saber expedition._

Launch a focused expedition into Powderfall Bluffs to capture elite Saber Slimes and secure critical endgame crafting resources.

### The Operational Blueprint

**Primary Objective:** Capture Saber Slimes and establish resource pipeline for late-game upgrades

**Financial Checkpoint:**
- **Starting Budget:** Should have 35,000-45,000+ Newbucks from Chapter 6 operations
- **Required:** ~8,000-18,000 Newbucks for upgrades (Extra Tank II: 3,000 NB, optional Tank Guard III: 10,000 NB, portal system: 2,500 NB)
- **Daily Revenue:** ~6,000-7,000 Newbucks from Conservatory + Gully + Tidepools
- **Timeline:** Achieve in 2-3 days through all operations
- **Farming Strategy:** If short on funds, spend 2-3 days farming plorts while simultaneously harvesting Powderfall Bluffs resources (Perfect Snowflakes, Sun Sap, Slime Fossils) during exploration runs

**Strategic Priorities:**

- Access Powderfall Bluffs via hidden waterfall entrance in Ember Valley
- Pop Saber Gordo to unlock permanent portal shortcut

| **Gordo** | **Food Required** | **Location** | **Reward** |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Saber Gordo** | 50 Meat (Thunderclucks count 2x) | Northern area, high mountain plateau | Portal shortcut to southern Ember Valley |

### Slime Locations for Powderfall Bluffs

**Powderfall Bluffs Slimes:**

| **Slime** | **Diet** | **Favorite** | **Largo?** | **Location** | **Special Notes** |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Saber** | Meat | Thundercluck | YES | Mountain plateaus and frozen caves (northern) | Aggressive, can stun with roar, deals contact damage, fast-moving |

| **Slime Fossil** | Cave walls | Endgame upgrades, Powderfall Bluffs Portal, Power Core III, Snowy Warp Depot |
| **Thunderclucks** | Wild coops in central valley and caves | Saber slime favorite food (includes 2 Roostros for breeding) |
| **Primordy Oil** | Various locations | Power Core upgrades (supplement Ember Valley collection) |
| **Lightning Mote** | During thunderstorms | Linked Cannons crafting |

### Current Ranch Status (No Changes This Chapter)

**Note:** No ranch reorganization this chapter. 

### Upgrade Path for this Chapter (Priority Order)

| **Upgrade** | **Cost** | **Materials** | **Effect** | **Component** | **Priority** |
|-------------|----------|---------------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Extra Tank II** | 3,000 NB | 40 Rock Plort, 20 Ringtail Plort, 20 Silky Sand, 2 Strange Diamond, 1 Vac Tank | Adds 5th vac slot | Vac Tank (Ch 3) | **RECOMMENDED** - Essential for Powderfall resource runs |
| **Tank Guard III** | 10,000 NB | 40 Crystal Plort, 30 Hunter Plort, 30 Buzz Wax, 2 Strange Diamond, 1 Tank Liner | Salvages 60% on damage | Tank Liner #3 (Ch 4) | OPTIONAL - Only if surplus Strange Diamonds |

**Material Sources:**
- Rock/Crystal Plorts: From your Conservatory Crystal-Rock corrals
- Ringtail Plorts: Collect wild at night from multiple biomes
- Hunter Plorts: Collect wild from Starlight Strand
- Silky Sand, Buzz Wax: Starlight Strand stockpile
- Strange Diamonds: Starlight Strand treasure pod (need to reserve 2 per Quantum Drone for Ch 9)

**Upgrade Components in Powderfall Bluffs:**
- **Storage Cell:** Northeast cliffside via aurora bridges (night only, 19:00-5:15) - Reserve for endgame
- **Sureshot Module:** Mountain summit near East Map Data Node - Needed for Golden Sureshot II
- **Power Chip:** Behind highest pink coral on coastal reef island - Reserve for endgame

**CRITICAL:** Sun Sap is the bottleneck material for late-game upgrades. Every Sun Sap tree location must be marked and revisited weekly.

### Treasure Pod Locations

**Priority 1 - Ultra-Rare Materials:**

- **Sun Sap x3:** Top of cliff in forested area (Jetpack required). Provides 3 Sun Sap-30% of total endgame requirements. Collect immediately.

**Priority 2 - Upgrade Components:**

- **Storage Cell:** Northeast cliffside via aurora bridges (night only, 19:00-5:15). Required for endgame upgrades.
- **Sureshot Module:** Mountain summit near East Map Data Node and Thundercluck nests (Jetpack required). Needed for Golden Sureshot II.
- **Power Chip:** Behind highest pink coral on coastal reef island (Jetpack required). Reserve for endgame upgrades.

**Priority 3 - Portal:**

- **Powderfall Bluffs Portal:** Main cave with fire flowers, ceiling accessible via aurora bridge (night recommended). Essential for weekly Sun Sap farming runs.

### Map Data Node Locations

- **Northern Mountain Summit (Primary Node):** Highest point on northern mountain near Saber Gordo location. Reveals majority of Powderfall Bluffs including Saber territory and ice caves.
- **Central Valley Plateau (Secondary Node):** Large icy plateau near frozen lake in central valley. Completes map coverage of lower elevations and forested areas.
- **Collection Priority:** Activate Northern Summit immediately upon entry-it's near the waterfall entrance route and provides comprehensive map awareness. Central Valley node is optional but helps with Sun Sap tree navigation.

### Refinery Link Deployment

Deploy a Refinery Link in Powderfall Bluffs for critical Sun Sap and Perfect Snowflake farming efficiency.

- **Crafting Requirements:** 250 Newbucks + 10 Phosphor Plorts + 10 Jellystone + 5 Deep Brine
- **Optimal Placement:** Central valley plateau near Secondary Map Data Node - provides easy access to Sun Sap trees, Perfect Snowflake cliffs, and Slime Fossil caves
- **Alternative Placement:** Near Saber Gordo plateau in northern mountains - closer to Perfect Snowflake spawns but requires more travel to reach Sun Sap trees in forested areas
- **Benefit:** Essential for depositing rare resources (especially Sun Sap) immediately upon collection. Prevents accidental loss from falls or Tarr encounters during extended exploration sessions.

### Portal System

Establish fast-travel access for critical Sun Sap and Perfect Snowflake farming.

**Phase 1: Powderfall Bluffs Portal (One-Way to Powderfall Bluffs)**

- **Blueprint Location:** Purple treasure pod in main cave with fire flowers (high ledge via aurora bridge, requires Jetpack)
- **Crafting Cost:** 2,000 Newbucks + 20 Saber Plorts + 5 Puddle Plorts + 10 Radiant Ore + 10 Slime Fossil
- **Placement (Conservatory-Side):** The Digsite (once unlocked in Chapter 11) or central Conservatory

**Phase 2: Blue Home Portal (One-Way to Conservatory)**

- **Crafting Cost:** 500 Newbucks + 10 Rock Plorts + 5 Radiant Ore + 5 Primordy Oil
- **Placement (Powderfall Bluffs-Side):** Central valley plateau near Secondary Map Data Node
- **Why Blue:** Most cost-effective option (only 500 Newbucks) and uses basic resources available from earlier chapters

**Total Investment:** 2,500 Newbucks + materials

**Priority:** Sun Sap is the rarest crafting material in the game with very slow respawns. This portal enables efficient weekly farming runs to check all marked tree locations. Essential for completing endgame Vacpack upgrades and Golden Sureshot upgrade series.

### Additional Powderfall Bluffs Tips

- Saber Slimes are aggressive and fast-moving. Use Pulse Wave liberally to create distance and prevent taking damage. Contact damage from their roar can quickly deplete your health.
- Thunderclucks are essential for efficient Saber ranching. Each Thundercluck feeding produces 2 Saber plorts (favorite food bonus) compared to 1 plort from standard meat.
- Sun Sap respawns very slowly. Prioritize marking every Sun Sap tree location on your first visit. Return every 5-7 in-game days to check respawns.
- Perfect Snowflakes are easier to spot at night due to their faint shimmer effect. Consider night exploration runs for resource farming.
- Aurora bridges appear only at night. Many treasure pods and shortcuts require these glowing bridges. Plan exploration during nighttime hours (after 6 PM game time).
- Weather Events: Powderfall Bluffs experiences dynamic weather including thunderstorms (when Lightning Motes spawn) and blizzards (reduced visibility).

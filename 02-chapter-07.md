## Chapter 7: Powderfall Bluffs - Saber Acquisition

**Mindset:** _Execute the Saber expedition._

Launch a focused expedition into Powderfall Bluffs to capture elite Saber Slimes and secure critical endgame crafting resources.

### The Operational Blueprint

**Primary Objective:** Capture Saber Slimes and establish resource pipeline for late-game upgrades

**Financial Checkpoint:**
- **Starting Budget:** Should have 35,000-45,000+ Newbucks from Chapter 6 operations
- **Required:** ~8,000-18,000 Newbucks for upgrades (Extra Tank II: 3,000 NB, optional Tank Guard III: 10,000 NB, portal system: 2,500 NB)
- **Daily Revenue:** ~6,000-7,000 Newbucks from Conservatory + Gully + Tidepools
- **Timeline:** Achieve in 2-3 days through all operations
- **Farming Strategy:** If short on funds, spend 2-3 days farming plorts while simultaneously harvesting Powderfall Bluffs resources (Perfect Snowflakes, Sun Sap, Slime Fossils) during exploration runs

**Strategic Priorities:**

- Access Powderfall Bluffs via hidden waterfall entrance in Ember Valley
- Pop Saber Gordo to unlock permanent portal shortcut
- Capture 10-12 Saber Slimes for Chapter 8 largo operations
- Harvest critical endgame resources (Perfect Snowflakes, Sun Sap, Slime Fossils)
- Collect Thunderclucks (Saber's favorite food) for breeding operations
- Activate all Map Data Nodes

**Key Success Metrics:**

- Saber Gordo popped, portal shortcut activated, treasure pods opened
- 10-12 Saber Slimes captured and ready for ranching
- 20-30 Thunderclucks collected for breeding program
- Resource stockpiles: 50+ Perfect Snowflakes, 5-10 Sun Sap, 30+ Slime Fossils
- Upgrades crafted: Extra Tank II (5th vac slot), Tank Guard III (optional)

#### Phase 1: Accessing Powderfall Bluffs

**Objective:** Locate and enter the hidden zone, activate Map Data Nodes.

**Entry Location:** Hidden waterfall entrance in southwestern Ember Valley

**How to Access:**
1. Enter Ember Valley from Rainbow Fields
2. Travel to the western volcanic region
3. Look for large waterfall near coastal area
4. Entrance is a frozen cave BEHIND the waterfall
5. Requires Jetpack to navigate vertical ice walls inside

**Recommended Equipment:**
- Heart Module III (250 HP), Power Core III (250 Energy), Jetpack II
- Water Tank, Pulse Wave, Tank Guard II
- 50+ meat for Saber Gordo and wild Saber feeding

**Map Data Node Locations:**

Powderfall Bluffs contains 2 Map Data Nodes. Activate these immediately upon entry:

- **Northern Mountain Summit (Primary Node):** Highest point on northern mountain near Saber Gordo location. Reveals majority of Powderfall Bluffs including Saber territory and ice caves.
- **Central Valley Plateau (Secondary Node):** Large icy plateau near frozen lake in central valley. Completes map coverage of lower elevations and forested areas.

**Collection Priority:** Activate Northern Summit immediately upon entry—it's near the waterfall entrance route and provides comprehensive map awareness. Central Valley node is optional but helps with Sun Sap tree navigation.

#### Phase 2: Gordo Strategy & Slime Acquisition

**Objective:** Pop Saber Gordo, capture breeding stock, collect favorite food.

**Gordo Location & Reward:**

| **Gordo** | **Food Required** | **Location** | **Reward** |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Saber Gordo** | 50 Meat (Thunderclucks count 2x) | Northern area, high mountain plateau | Portal shortcut to southern Ember Valley + 12 Saber Slimes + 1 jar |

**Powderfall Bluffs Slimes:**

| **Slime** | **Diet** | **Favorite** | **Largo?** | **Location** | **Special Notes** |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Saber** | Meat | Thundercluck | YES | Mountain plateaus and frozen caves (northern) | Aggressive, can stun with roar, deals contact damage, fast-moving |
| **Pink** | Omnivore | Any | YES | Throughout Powderfall Bluffs | Most common slime, eats anything |
| **Phosphor** | Fruit | Cuberry | YES | Throughout (NIGHT ONLY) | Glowing, requires Solar Shield in corrals |
| **Puddle** | None (Water) | None | NO | Frozen ponds and water sources | Passive, can only be ranched in Pond plots, produces plorts in water |
| **Cotton** | Veggie | Water Lettuce | YES | Grassy areas in valleys | Natural high jumpers, require High Walls |
| **Tabby** | Meat | Stony Hen | YES | Throughout Powderfall Bluffs | Common, agile cat-like slimes, jump frequently |
| **Rock** | Veggie | Heart Beet | YES | Rocky terrain and cave entrances | Deals contact damage when rolling |

**Asset Acquisition Strategy:**

**Saber Slimes (Target: 10-12)**
- **Location:** Northern plateau areas near Saber Gordo
- **Method:** Pop Saber Gordo first to get 12 free Saber Slimes
- **Tactics:** Use Pulse Wave for crowd control—Sabers are aggressive and fast
- **Transport:** Return to ranch via Saber Gordo portal (southern Ember Valley) → Rainbow Fields → Conservatory

**Thunderclucks (Target: 20-30)**
- **Location:** Wild coops in central valley and caves
- **Includes:** 2 Roostros for breeding program
- **Purpose:** Saber favorite food (2 plorts per feeding vs 1 for regular meat)

#### Phase 3: Resource Extraction & Treasure Pods

**Objective:** Harvest critical endgame resources and open priority treasure pods.

**Powderfall Bluffs Resources:**

| **Resource** | **Location** | **Uses** |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Perfect Snowflake** | Cliff faces (glimmering) | Endgame Vacpack upgrades (Tank Booster IV, Golden Sureshot series), Snowball Machine |
| **Sun Sap** | Frozen trees (golden sap) | ULTRA-RARE - CRITICAL bottleneck for endgame upgrades (Power Core IV, Golden Sureshot series) - MARK ALL TREES |
| **Slime Fossil** | Cave walls | Endgame upgrades, Powderfall Bluffs Portal, Power Core III, Snowy Warp Depot |
| **Thunderclucks** | Wild coops in central valley and caves | Saber slime favorite food (includes 2 Roostros for breeding) |
| **Primordy Oil** | Various locations | Power Core upgrades (supplement Ember Valley collection) |
| **Lightning Mote** | During thunderstorms | Linked Cannons crafting |

**CRITICAL:** Sun Sap is the bottleneck material for late-game upgrades. Every Sun Sap tree location must be marked and revisited weekly (5-7 in-game days for respawns).

**Treasure Pod Priorities:**

**Priority 1 - Ultra-Rare Materials:**
- **Sun Sap x3:** Top of cliff in forested area (Jetpack required). Provides 3 Sun Sap—30% of total endgame requirements. Collect immediately.

**Priority 2 - Upgrade Components:**
- **Storage Cell:** Northeast cliffside via aurora bridges (night only, 19:00-5:15). Required for endgame upgrades.
- **Sureshot Module:** Mountain summit near East Map Data Node and Thundercluck nests (Jetpack required). Needed for Golden Sureshot II.
- **Power Chip:** Behind highest pink coral on coastal reef island (Jetpack required). Reserve for endgame upgrades.

**Priority 3 - Portal Blueprint:**
- **Powderfall Bluffs Portal:** Main cave with fire flowers, ceiling accessible via aurora bridge (night recommended). Essential for weekly Sun Sap farming runs.

**Important Note:** Aurora bridges appear only at night (after 19:00). Many treasure pods and shortcuts require these glowing bridges. Plan exploration during nighttime hours.

#### Phase 4: Vacpack Upgrades

**Objective:** Craft Extra Tank II for expanded inventory capacity.

| **Upgrade** | **Cost** | **Materials** | **Effect** | **Component** | **Priority** |
|-------------|----------|---------------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Extra Tank II** | 3,000 NB | 40 Rock Plort, 20 Ringtail Plort, 20 Silky Sand, 2 Strange Diamond, 1 Vac Tank | Adds 5th vac slot | Vac Tank (Ch 3) | **RECOMMENDED** - Essential for Powderfall resource runs |
| **Tank Guard III** | 10,000 NB | 40 Crystal Plort, 30 Hunter Plort, 30 Buzz Wax, 2 Strange Diamond, 1 Tank Liner | Salvages 60% on damage | Tank Liner #3 (Ch 4) | OPTIONAL - Only if surplus Strange Diamonds |

**Material Sources:**
- Rock/Crystal Plorts: From your Conservatory Crystal-Rock corrals
- Ringtail Plorts: Collect wild at night from multiple biomes
- Hunter Plorts: Collect wild from Starlight Strand
- Silky Sand, Buzz Wax: Starlight Strand stockpile
- Strange Diamonds: Starlight Strand treasure pod (need to reserve 2 per Quantum Drone for Ch 9)

#### Phase 5: Warp Infrastructure Setup

**Objective:** Establish fast-travel access for efficient Sun Sap and resource farming.

**Deploy Refinery Link:**

- **Crafting Requirements:** 250 Newbucks + 10 Phosphor Plorts + 10 Jellystone + 5 Deep Brine
- **Optimal Placement:** Central valley plateau near Secondary Map Data Node—provides easy access to Sun Sap trees, Perfect Snowflake cliffs, and Slime Fossil caves
- **Benefit:** Essential for depositing rare resources (especially Sun Sap) immediately upon collection. Prevents accidental loss from falls or Tarr encounters during extended exploration sessions.

**Deploy Portal System:**

**Powderfall Bluffs Portal (One-Way to Powderfall Bluffs):**
- **Blueprint Location:** Purple treasure pod in main cave with fire flowers (high ledge via aurora bridge, requires Jetpack)
- **Crafting Cost:** 2,000 Newbucks + 20 Saber Plorts + 5 Puddle Plorts + 10 Radiant Ore + 10 Slime Fossil
- **Placement (Conservatory-Side):** The Digsite (once unlocked in Chapter 11) or central Conservatory

**Blue Home Portal (One-Way to Conservatory):**
- **Crafting Cost:** 500 Newbucks + 10 Rock Plorts + 5 Radiant Ore + 5 Primordy Oil
- **Placement (Powderfall Bluffs-Side):** Central valley plateau near Secondary Map Data Node
- **Why Blue:** Most cost-effective option (only 500 Newbucks) and uses basic resources available from earlier chapters

**Total Warp Investment:** 2,750 Newbucks + materials (250 NB Refinery Link + 2,500 NB Portal System)

**Strategic Rationale:** Sun Sap is the rarest crafting material in the game with very slow respawns (5-7 in-game days). This portal enables efficient weekly farming runs to check all marked tree locations. Essential for completing endgame Vacpack upgrades and Golden Sureshot upgrade series.

### Strategic Priorities

1. **Map First:** Activate Northern Mountain Summit Map Data Node immediately upon entry for comprehensive map coverage.
2. **Pop Saber Gordo:** Unlock portal shortcut and receive 12 free Saber Slimes to skip wild capture.
3. **Mark Sun Sap Trees:** CRITICAL—every Sun Sap tree location must be marked for future weekly farming (5-7 day respawns).
4. **Collect Thunderclucks:** 20-30 Thunderclucks (including Roostros) for breeding program and Saber favorite food.
5. **Priority Treasure Pods:** Sun Sap x3 treasure pod (30% of endgame requirements), Powderfall Portal blueprint.
6. **Deploy Warp Infrastructure:** Refinery Link + Portal system for efficient resource farming returns.
7. **Craft Extra Tank II:** 5th vac slot essential for extended resource collection runs.

### Financial Checkpoint

**Capital Required:**
- Extra Tank II: 3,000 Newbucks
- Tank Guard III (optional): 10,000 Newbucks
- Warp Infrastructure: 2,750 Newbucks (Refinery Link 250 NB + Portal System 2,500 NB)
- Materials: Rock/Ringtail/Hunter Plorts, Saber Plorts, Phosphor Plorts, Jellystone, Deep Brine, Silky Sand, Radiant Ore, Slime Fossil (from existing operations and Powderfall harvesting)
- **Total: ~5,750-15,750 Newbucks** (depending on optional Tank Guard III)

**No Direct Revenue Added:**

This chapter focuses on resource extraction and Saber acquisition. The captured Saber Slimes will generate revenue in Chapter 8 (The Den reorganization) when converted to Saber-Hunter Largos in The Gully.

**Estimated Revenue from Chapter 8 Preview:**
- Saber-Hunter Largos (Gully Plot 5): ~1,500-2,000 Newbucks/day

## Chapter 14: Prismacore Stabilization - Story Finale

**Mindset:** _Completing the mission._

You've prepared everything. You've opened all Shadow Plort Doors. You've stockpiled Prisma Plorts. Now it's time to enter the Prismacore and save Rainbow Island.

### The Operational Blueprint

#### Phase 1: Navigate to Prismacore

**Location:** Heart of the Grey Labyrinth (accessed through Impossible Sky)

**Access Requirements:**
- Must have opened plort statue doors (Twin, Shadow, Sloomber) to reach Prismacore entrance
- Follow the path from Impossible Sky toward the gilded area

**What to Bring:**
- ~90 Prisma Plorts (for Gigi trades)
- Throwable items (for Harmonizer activation)
- Full health/energy (Tarr barrier ahead)

#### Phase 2: Trade with Gigi

**Location:** Gigi's station inside the Prismacore area

**Milestone Trades (one-time rewards):**
- 20 Prisma Plorts → Nullifier blueprint
- 20 Prisma Plorts → Storage Cell
- 50 Prisma Plorts → Drone Station Module
- **Total for all milestones: 90 Prisma Plorts**

**Unlimited Trade:**
- 10 Prisma Plorts → 1 Rainbow Coin (repeatable)
- Use this for Night Market purchases post-game

**After Trading:** Return to The Lab and craft the Nullifier

#### Phase 3: Craft the Nullifier

**Recipe:**
- 1,000 Newbucks
- 20 Shadow Plorts
- 20 Hyper Plorts
- 20 Twin Plorts
- 20 Sloomber Plorts

**All plort types should be available from your Chapter 11-12 operations and Grey Labyrinth farming.**

#### Phase 4: Activate the 5 Harmonizers

**Location:** Hidden throughout the Grey Labyrinth zones

**Activation:** Shoot any item at each Harmonizer to activate it

**Harmonizer Locations:**
Reference the Slime Rancher 2 wiki or explore systematically through each Grey Labyrinth zone to find all 5.

**Status Tracking:** The game tracks how many Harmonizers you've activated

#### Phase 5: Prismacore Stabilization

**Location:** Interior of the Prismacore

**The Tarr Barrier:**
- A giant Tarr barrier surrounds the Prismacore's core
- Cannot be crossed or destroyed with water

**The Slime Shower:**
- Two depositing ports available
- Deposit 6 slimes total (any combination) into either port
- The Slime Shower breaks the Tarr barrier
- **Where to get slimes:** Bring from ranch OR catch wild slimes in Grey Labyrinth

**Nullifier Deployment:**
- After Tarr barrier is broken, approach the Prismacore core
- Deploy the Nullifier device
- **Cutscene:** Rainbow Island stabilizes, Prisma Disruptions cease

#### Phase 6: Story Resolution

**Gigi's Departure:**
- Gigi leaves the Grey Labyrinth to reunite with her family
- Returns to her timeline through a portal
- Most holographic pads become non-interactive
- Prismacore pad shows a recorded message from Gigi

**Unlocks:**
- Unlimited Rainbow Coin trading at Prismacore Exchange
- Grey Labyrinth remains accessible (no more disruptions, but Stabilizers remain)
- Night Market access via Rainbow Coins

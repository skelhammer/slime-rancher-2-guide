## Chapter 14: Prismacore Stabilization - Story Finale

**Mindset:** _Completing the mission._

You've prepared everything. You've opened all Shadow Plort Doors. You've stockpiled Prisma Plorts. Now it's time to enter the Prismacore and save Rainbow Island.

### Understanding the Threat

**What is the Prismacore?**

The Prismacore is an extraterrestrial object discovered long ago that crashed into Rainbow Island. It is the source of all Prisma Disruption in the Grey Labyrinth, causing resources to become unstable and elemental properties to shift unpredictably.

**The Escalating Crisis:**

Outside the Grey Labyrinth, the Prismacore's effects are mostly chromatic—visual distortions and color shifts. Inside the Labyrinth, however, the effects are amplified and life-threatening. Areas surrounding the Prismacore are slowly turning to gold, their structures failing and becoming nearly invisible before vanishing entirely.

**What Happens if Left Unchecked:**

According to Gigi's research, if the Prismacore is not stabilized:
- The structures surrounding the Prismacore will collapse or vanish
- Dream Land will grow heavy and fall from the sky
- The Labyrinth's generated atmosphere will collapse
- Once the Grey Labyrinth falls, Prismacore energy will radiate across the entire Far, Far Range
- The world will become unrecognizable, and all life—including all slimes—will be lost

**Your Mission:** Activate 5 Harmonizers hidden throughout the Labyrinth, break through the Tarr barrier protecting the core, and deploy the Nullifier to stabilize the Prismacore permanently.

**IMPORTANT:** Even after stabilization, Prisma disruption effects will persist for a long time before the Far, Far Range fully recovers. The Stabilizers in the Labyrinth remain necessary.

### The Operational Blueprint

#### Phase 1: Navigate to Prismacore

**Location:** Heart of the Grey Labyrinth (accessed through Impossible Sky)

**Access Requirements:**
- Must have opened plort statue doors (Twin, Shadow, Sloomber) to reach Prismacore entrance
- Follow the path from Impossible Sky toward the gilded area

**What to Bring:**
- ~90 Prisma Plorts (for Gigi trades)
- Throwable items (for Harmonizer activation)
- Full health/energy (Tarr barrier ahead)

#### Phase 2: Trade with Gigi

**Location:** Gigi's station inside the Prismacore area

**Milestone Trades (one-time rewards):**
- 20 Prisma Plorts → Nullifier blueprint
- 20 Prisma Plorts → Storage Cell
- 50 Prisma Plorts → Drone Station Module
- **Total for all milestones: 90 Prisma Plorts**

**Unlimited Trade:**
- 10 Prisma Plorts → 1 Rainbow Coin (repeatable)
- Use this for Night Market purchases post-game

**After Trading:** Return to The Lab and craft the Nullifier

#### Phase 3: Craft the Nullifier

**Recipe:**
- 1,000 Newbucks
- 20 Shadow Plorts
- 20 Hyper Plorts
- 20 Twin Plorts
- 20 Sloomber Plorts

**All plort types should be available from your Chapter 11-12 operations and Grey Labyrinth farming.**

#### Phase 4: Activate the 5 Harmonizers

**Location:** Hidden throughout the Grey Labyrinth zones

**Activation:** Shoot any item at each Harmonizer to activate it (fruits, vegetables, plorts, chickens—anything works)

**Harmonizer Locations:**

The 5 Harmonizers are distributed across the Grey Labyrinth zones. Explore each area systematically:

1. **Prismacore Surroundings** - Check the gilded areas near the core
2. **Dream Land** zones (East, West, Central) - Look for elevated platforms and hidden alcoves
3. **Impossible Sky** zones - Explore vertical structures and floating platforms
4. **The Mirage** - Search desert-like areas with unstable terrain
5. **Shifting Caverns** - Check cave systems and tunnels

**Search Strategy:**
- Harmonizers emit a faint glow and distinctive sound when nearby
- Use your map to track which zones you've thoroughly explored
- Revisit areas if you've only passed through quickly
- Some require platforming or navigating around Stabilizers

**Status Tracking:** The game tracks how many Harmonizers you've activated. You must activate all 5 before you can stabilize the Prismacore.

#### Phase 5: Prismacore Stabilization

**Location:** Interior of the Prismacore

**The Tarr Barrier:**
- A giant Tarr barrier surrounds the Prismacore's core
- Cannot be crossed or destroyed with water

**The Slime Shower:**

The Slime Shower is a large facility inside the Prismacore designed specifically to break the Tarr barrier. It requires a slime sacrifice to activate.

- **Two depositing ports:** Choose either one (both work identically)
- **Requirement:** Deposit 6 slimes total into a single port
- **Any slime type works:** Pink, Rock, Phosphor, Largos—doesn't matter
- **Source options:**
  - Bring 6 slimes from your ranch (vacpack them up before entering)
  - Catch 6 wild slimes in the Grey Labyrinth zones
  - Mix of both sources

**Activation Process:**
1. Approach either depositing port
2. Shoot 6 slimes into the port (they will be absorbed)
3. The Slime Shower activates automatically
4. The Tarr barrier dissolves, revealing the path to the Prismacore core

**Strategic Note:** Using wild slimes from the Labyrinth is more efficient than bringing your valuable ranch largos. Pink slimes and common wild slimes work perfectly.

**Nullifier Deployment:**
- After Tarr barrier is broken, approach the Prismacore core
- Deploy the Nullifier device
- **Cutscene:** Rainbow Island stabilizes, Prisma Disruptions cease

#### Phase 6: Story Resolution

**Gigi's Departure:**

After stabilization, Gigi leaves the Grey Labyrinth to reunite with her family, then returns to her own timeline through the "Portal beyond space and time" in the Glass Desert (which repairs itself after the Prismacore stabilization).

- Gigi says her final goodbyes before departing
- She will never be seen again after leaving
- Most holographic pads showing Gigi's standing pose become non-interactive
- The Prismacore holographic pad remains functional, showing a recorded farewell message

**World Changes:**

- **Prismacore stabilized:** All readings normalized, Rainbow Island's future secured
- **Prisma disruption persists:** Effects will last for a long time before fully recovering
- **Stabilizers remain necessary:** The Ancient Stabilizers in the Labyrinth zones stay active
- **The Prismacore becomes part of the Far, Far Range:** No longer a threat, now integrated into the world

**Post-Game Unlocks:**

- **Unlimited Rainbow Coin trading:** 10 Prisma Plorts → 1 Rainbow Coin (repeatable forever)
- **Night Market access:** Spend Rainbow Coins at ProntoMart for exclusive upgrades and decorations
- **Grey Labyrinth exploration:** Remains fully accessible for resource farming
- **Prismatic decorations:** New ranch customization options via Night Market

**Gadget Restriction:** You cannot place gadgets inside the Prismacore interior. Attempting to access Gadget Mode displays: "Gadgets are not working".

## Chapter 14: Post-Game - Sandbox Empire

**Mindset:** _The Creative Endgame._

With all strategic objectives complete, the blueprint is fulfilled. The focus now shifts from guided efficiency to self-directed projects that define your ranching legacy.

### The Operational Blueprint

#### Phase 1: The Master Economist - Infinite Wealth

With all slime types available, your income potential is virtually limitless. The post-game economic objective is to move beyond simple daily profit and begin manipulating the market itself, engaging with the endgame currency system.

**Advanced Market Manipulation:**

- **Objective:** To generate a massive, single-day profit by artificially creating scarcity and demand.
- **Strategy:**
  - **Select a Target Plort:** Choose a single, high-value plort (e.g., Saber, Ringtail, or Hyper).
  - **Hoard:** Dedicate several ranch expansions to producing only this plort. Do not sell it. Stockpile a massive quantity (1,000+) in Silos.
  - **Crash the Market:** Sell every other plort type you produce. Flood the market daily to drive their prices down.
  - **Wait for the Spike:** As other plort prices remain depressed, the Plort Market algorithm will eventually create a "high demand" day for your hoarded plort, potentially spiking its value to 200% or more.
  - **Execute the Sell-Off:** On the day of the price spike, sell your entire stockpile at once for a colossal profit, potentially earning hundreds of thousands of Newbucks in a single day.

**Engaging the Endgame Economy: ProntoMart & The Night Market** With the main story complete, the final economic phase begins. This revolves around ProntoMart, the main in-game shop accessible from any shop terminal, and its exclusive endgame section, The Night Market.

- **ProntoMart:** This shop has two standard sections:
  - **Coo-Coo Corner:** Sells a small, random selection of items that refresh daily at 12:00.
  - **Polestar Provisions:** Sells a large, permanent selection of blueprints for decorations, gadgets, and key upgrade components.
- **The Night Market:** This is the secret, endgame tier of ProntoMart.
  - **Unlock Condition:** Access is granted after you stabilize the Prismacore and speak with Gigi at the plort exchange station.
  - **Availability:** The Night Market is only open during the night, from 20:00 to 4:00 game time.
  - **Currency:** It uses an exclusive currency called **Rainbow Coins**, which are obtained by trading Prisma Plorts to Gigi.
  - **Wares:** It sells the game's most exclusive items, including special prismatic color variants, advanced drone modules, unique decorations, and the final Sureshot upgrades.

#### Phase 2: The Grand Architect - Perfecting the Ranch

Your ranch is currently built for pure efficiency. Now, you have the capital to redesign it for aesthetics, creating a stunning showcase of your achievements.

**Themed Expansions:**

- Demolish functional but plain layouts and rebuild entire expansions with a single theme in mind.
- **Example Themes:**
  - **The Volcanic Caldera (The Gully):** Use Boom, Rock, Crystal, and Fire slimes. Decorate with Ash Troughs, Ember Valley trees, and lava-themed decorations.
  - **The Bioluminescent Grotto (The Archway):** Use Phosphor, Batty, Shadow, and Twin slimes. Keep all corrals under Solar Shields and use glowing plants and crystals to create a perpetual nighttime environment.
  - **The Serene Water Gardens (The Tidepools):** Use only Puddle and Flutter slimes. Decorate with ponds, Starlight Strand flora, and zen-like arrangements.

**The Largo Library:**

- **Objective:** Create a living museum of every possible largo combination in the game.
- **Execution:** Dedicate The Den and The Digsite to this project. Build a series of perfectly designed, fully-automated corrals. Each corral will house 5-6 largos of a single, unique type. This is the ultimate test of your ranch design and automation skills, creating a visually spectacular and orderly display of biodiversity.

#### Phase 3: The Technologist - Ultimate Automation

Mastering the Quantum Drones is the final step in achieving a ranch that runs itself.

**Advanced Drone Deployment:**

- **Explorer Mode:** Deploy drones to remote locations outside your ranch to passively generate rare resources.
  - **Prime Locations:** Place an Explorer Drone in Powderfall Bluffs (generates Sun Sap, Perfect Snowflakes), or in the Grey Labyrinth lava areas (generates Black Indigonium, Magma Comb).
  - **Function:** The drone will automatically generate these resources (not from actual nodes, but from "quantum" sources) and deposit them into a "Quantum Cloud" inventory (max 9,999 items), accessible from any Drone Station at your ranch. This creates a fully automated, off-site resource generation network.
- **Price Spike Management:** For manual price spike selling, program drones to collect plorts to Silos instead of Market Links. Monitor the Plort Market daily and manually sell from Silos during 150%+ price spikes for maximum profit.

#### Phase 4: The Archivist - 100% Completion

For the ultimate completionist, the goal is to achieve everything the game has to offer.

**The Completionist's Checklist:**

- **Slimepedia:** Discover every slime, food item, resource, and location to complete all entries.
- **Gordo Snaring:** Pop every Gordo Slime in the game, including all 3 in the Grey Labyrinth.
- **Treasure Pods:** Hunt down and crack open every last treasure pod. The final, most difficult pods often require a maxed-out Jetpack and clever use of the environment.
- **Gadget Crafting:** Craft at least one of every single gadget, decoration, and utility item in the Fabricator.
- **Blueprint Collection:** Locate every treasure pod and unlock all available upgrades, gadgets, and decorations at the Fabricator.

#### Phase 5: The Renegade Rancher - Challenge Runs

Start a new save file and apply a set of self-imposed rules for a completely different gameplay experience.

- **Carnivore Only:** You may only ranch meat-eating slimes. This puts immense pressure on your chicken coop management.
- **No Automation:** No Plort Collectors, Auto-Feeders, or Drones. You must manage everything manually.
- **Single Largo Base:** Every largo on your ranch must be based on a single slime type (e.g., every largo must be part-Tabby).
- **Pacifist Rancher:** You must prevent the creation of Tarrs at all costs. Any Tarr outbreak is a failure condition.
- **One Expansion Only:** You may only purchase one ranch expansion beyond the Conservatory for the entire game. Choose wisely.

_The blueprint is complete, Rancher. The systems are in place. The wealth, technology, and resources of Rainbow Island are at your command. Now, go build your empire._
